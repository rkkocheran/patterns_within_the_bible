1,Genesis 1:1-2:3,"[Genesis] [ch 1] [verse 1] In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. [verse 10] And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. [verse 11] And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, [and] fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so. [verse 12] And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good. [verse 13] And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. [verse 14] And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years: [verse 15] and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. [verse 16] And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also. [verse 17] And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth, [verse 18] and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. [verse 19] And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. [verse 2] And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. [verse 20] And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. [verse 21] And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good. [verse 22] And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth. [verse 23] And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. [verse 24] And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so. [verse 25] And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good. [verse 26] And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. [verse 27] And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. [verse 28] And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. [verse 29] And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food: [verse 3] And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. [verse 30] and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, [I have given] every green herb for food: and it was so. [verse 31] And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day. [verse 4] And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. [verse 5] And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. [verse 6] And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. [verse 7] And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. [verse 8] And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. [verse 9] And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. [ch 2] [verse 1] And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. [verse 2] And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. [verse 3] And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made."

[verse 14] Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. [verse 15] And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. [verse 16] A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. [verse 17] And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in the earth shall die. [verse 18] But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. [verse 19] And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. [verse 20] Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. [verse 21] And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them."
29,Genesis 7:1-4,"[Genesis] [ch 7] [verse 1] And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. [verse 2] Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female: [verse 3] of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. [verse 4] For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground."

31,Genesis 6:17-8:22,"[Genesis] [ch 6] [verse 17] And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in the earth shall die. [verse 18] But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. [verse 19] And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. [verse 20] Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. [verse 21] And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. [verse 22] Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he. [ch 7] [verse 1] And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. [verse 10] And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. [verse 11] In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. [verse 12] And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. [verse 13] In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; [verse 14] they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort. [verse 15] And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life. [verse 16] And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and Jehovah shut him in. [verse 17] And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth. [verse 18] And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. [verse 19] And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered. [verse 2] Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female: [verse 20] Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. [verse 21] And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: [verse 22] all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died. [verse 23] And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark. [verse 24] And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days. [verse 3] of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. [verse 4] For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground. [verse 5] And Noah did according unto all that Jehovah commanded him. [verse 6] And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. [verse 7] And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. [verse 8] Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creepeth upon the ground, [verse 9] there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah. [ch 8] [verse 1] And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged; [verse 10] And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; [verse 11] and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. [verse 12] And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more. [verse 13] And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dried. [verse 14] And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry. [verse 15] And God spake unto Noah, saying, [verse 16] Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. [verse 17] Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. [verse 18] And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: [verse 19] every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark. [verse 2] the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; [verse 20] And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar. [verse 21] And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for that the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have done. [verse 22] While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. [verse 3] and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased. [verse 4] And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. [verse 5] And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. [verse 6] And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: [verse 7] and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. [verse 8] And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; [verse 9] but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark."
32,Genesis 8:1,"[Genesis] [ch 8] [verse 1] And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;"
33,Genesis 8:15-17,"[Genesis] [ch 8] [verse 15] And God spake unto Noah, saying, [verse 16] Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. [verse 17] Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth."
34,Genesis 9:1-7,"[Genesis] [ch 9] [verse 1] And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. [verse 2] And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens; with all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered. [verse 3] Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all. [verse 4] But flesh with the life thereof, [which is] the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. [verse 5] And surely your blood, [the blood] of your lives, will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, will I require the life of man. [verse 6] Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: For in the image of God made he man. [verse 7] And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein."
35,Genesis 9:8-17,"[Genesis] [ch 9] [verse 10] and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth. [verse 11] And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. [verse 12] And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: [verse 13] I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. [verse 14] And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud, [verse 15] and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. [verse 16] And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. [verse 17] And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth. [verse 8] And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, [verse 9] And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;"
36,Genesis 11:1-9,"[Genesis] [ch 11] [verse 1] And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. [verse 2] And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. [verse 3] And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. [verse 4] And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top [may reach] unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. [verse 5] And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. [verse 6] And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do. [verse 7] Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. [verse 8] So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city. [verse 9] Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth."
37,Genesis 12:1-3,"[Genesis] [ch 12] [verse 1] Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee: [verse 2] and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make they name great; and be thou a blessing: [verse 3] and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
38,Genesis 12:7,"[Genesis] [ch 12] [verse 7] And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him."

[verse 2] And Abram said, O Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus? [verse 3] And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. [verse 4] And, behold, the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, This man shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

[verse 15] But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. [verse 16] And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full. [verse 17] And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces. [verse 18] In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: [verse 19] the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite, [verse 20] and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim, [verse 21] and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.

[verse 14] Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. [verse 7] And the angel of Jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. [verse 8] And he said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.

[verse 16] And I will bless her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be [a mother of] nations; kings of peoples shall be of her. [verse 2] And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. [verse 3] And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, [verse 4] As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations. [verse 5] Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.

[verse 5] Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this. [verse 6] And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou has done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.

96,Genesis 38:10,[Genesis] [ch 38] [verse 10] And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and he slew him also.
97,"Genesis 40:5-11, 40:16-17","[Genesis] [ch 40] [verse 10] and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, [and] its blossoms shot forth; [and] the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: [verse 11] and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. [verse 16] When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head: [verse 17] and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. [verse 5] And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison. [verse 6] And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad. [verse 7] And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in ward in his master's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sad to-day? [verse 8] And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you. [verse 9] And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;"
98,"Genesis 40:8, 40:12-13, 40:18-19","[Genesis] [ch 40] [verse 12] And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days; [verse 13] within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. [verse 18] And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days; [verse 19] within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee. [verse 8] And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you."
99,Genesis 41:1-7,"[Genesis] [ch 41] [verse 1] And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. [verse 2] And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favored and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass. [verse 3] And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. [verse 4] And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. [verse 5] And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, rank and good. [verse 6] And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. [verse 7] And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream."
100,Genesis 41:14-32,"[Genesis] [ch 41] [verse 14] Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. [verse 15] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it. [verse 16] And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace. [verse 17] And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river: [verse 18] and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and well-favored: and they fed in the reed-grass: [verse 19] and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: [verse 20] and the lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: [verse 21] and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke. [verse 22] And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good: [verse 23] and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: [verse 24] and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me. [verse 25] And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about to do he hath declared unto Pharaoh. [verse 26] The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. [verse 27] And the seven lean and ill-favored kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine. [verse 28] That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath showed unto Pharaoh. [verse 29] Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: [verse 30] and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; [verse 31] and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous. [verse 32] And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
101,Genesis 41:47-49,"[Genesis] [ch 41] [verse 47] And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. [verse 48] And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. [verse 49] And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number."
102,Genesis 41:53-57,"[Genesis] [ch 41] [verse 53] And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end. [verse 54] And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. [verse 55] And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. [verse 56] And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt. [verse 57] And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was sore in all the earth."
103,Genesis 46:2-4,"[Genesis] [ch 46] [verse 2] And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I. [verse 3] And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: [verse 4] I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes."
104,Genesis 49:1-27,"[Genesis] [ch 49] [verse 1] And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days. [verse 10] The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh come; And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be. [verse 11] Binding his foal unto the vine, And his ass's colt unto the choice vine; He hath washed his garments in wine, And his vesture in the blood of grapes: [verse 12] His eyes shall be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk. [verse 13] Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; And he shall be for a haven of ships; And his border shall be upon Sidon. [verse 14] Issachar is a strong ass, Couching down between the sheepfolds: [verse 15] And he saw a resting-place that it was good, And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became a servant under taskwork. [verse 16] Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel. [verse 17] Dan shall be a serpent in the way, An adder in the path, That biteth the horse's heels, So that his rider falleth backward. [verse 18] I have waited for thy salvation, O Jehovah. [verse 19] Gad, a troop shall press upon him; But he shall press upon their heel. [verse 2] Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; And hearken unto Israel your father. [verse 20] Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, And he shall yield royal dainties. [verse 21] Naphtali is a hind let loose: He giveth goodly words. [verse 22] Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a fountain; His branches run over the wall. [verse 23] The archers have sorely grieved him, And shot at him, and persecuted him: [verse 24] But his bow abode in strength, And the arms of his hands were made strong, By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel), [ [verse 25] Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee, With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath, Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb. [verse 26] The blessings of thy father Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: They shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. [verse 27] Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth: In the morning he shall devour the prey, And at even he shall divide the spoil. [verse 3] Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength; The pre-eminence of dignity, and the pre-eminence of power. [verse 4] Boiling over as water, thou shalt not have the pre-eminence; Because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch. [verse 5] Simeon and Levi are brethren; Weapons of violence are their swords. [verse 6] O my soul, come not thou into their council; Unto their assembly, my glory, be not thou united; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their self-will they hocked [ an ox. [verse 7] Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; And their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel. [verse 8] Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise: Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; Thy father's sons shall bow down before thee. [verse 9] Judah is a lion's whelp; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up: He stooped down, he couched as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?"
105,Exodus 1:20-21,"[Exodus] [ch 1] [verse 20] And God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. [verse 21] And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households."
106,Exodus 2:24-25,"[Exodus] [ch 2] [verse 24] And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. [verse 25] And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge [of them] ."
107,Exodus 3:2-3,"[Exodus] [ch 3] [verse 2] And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. [verse 3] And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."
108,Exodus 3:4-4:17,"[Exodus] [ch 3] [verse 10] Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. [verse 11] And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? [verse 12] And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. [verse 13] And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them? [verse 14] And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. [verse 15] And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. [verse 16] Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and [seen] that which is done to you in Egypt: [verse 17] and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. [verse 18] And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath met with us: and now let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God. [verse 19] And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand. [verse 20] And I will put forth my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. [verse 21] And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty: [verse 22] but every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall despoil the Egyptians. [verse 4] And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. [verse 5] And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. [verse 6] Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. [verse 7] And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; [verse 8] and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. [verse 9] And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. [ch 4] [verse 1] And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, Jehovah hath not appeared unto thee. [verse 10] And Moses said unto Jehovah, Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. [verse 11] And Jehovah said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? Or who maketh [a man] dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? is it not I, Jehovah? [verse 12] Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak. [verse 13] And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. [verse 14] And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. [verse 15] And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. [verse 16] And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as God. [verse 17] And thou shalt take in thy hand this rod, wherewith thou shalt do the signs. [verse 2] And Jehovah said unto him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod. [verse 3] And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. [verse 4] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail (and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand); [verse 5] that they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee. [verse 6] And Jehovah said furthermore unto him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as [white as] snow. [verse 7] And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his [other] flesh.) [verse 8] And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. [verse 9] And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land."

112,Exodus 4:7,"[Exodus] [ch 4] [verse 7] And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his [other] flesh.)"
113,Exodus 4:9,"[Exodus] [ch 4] [verse 9] And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land."
114,Exodus 4:12-15,"[Exodus] [ch 4] [verse 12] Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak. [verse 13] And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. [verse 14] And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.

[verse 15] And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.

[verse 16] And thou shalt say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou hast not hearkened. [verse 17] Thus saith Jehovah, In this thou shalt know that I am Jehovah: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. [verse 18] And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river."
128,Exodus 7:19,"[Exodus] [ch 7] [verse 19] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone."
129,Exodus 7:20-25,"[Exodus] [ch 7] [verse 20] And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. [verse 21] And the fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt. [verse 22] And the magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken. [verse 23] And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart. [verse 24] And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. [verse 25] And seven days were fulfilled, after that Jehovah had smitten the river."
130,Exodus 8:1-4,"[Exodus] [ch 8] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me. [verse 2] And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: [verse 3] and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs: [verse 4] and the frogs shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants."
131,Exodus 8:5,"[Exodus] [ch 8] [verse 5] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt."
132,Exodus 8:6-7,"[Exodus] [ch 8] [verse 6] And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. [verse 7] And the magicians did in like manner with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt."
133,Exodus 8:8-13,"[Exodus] [ch 8] [verse 10] And he said, Against to-morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like unto Jehovah our God. [verse 11] And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only. [verse 12] And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto Jehovah concerning the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh. [verse 13] And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields. [verse 8] Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat Jehovah, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto Jehovah. [verse 9] And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Have thou this glory over me: against what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?"
134,Exodus 8:16,"[Exodus] [ch 8] [verse 16] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt."
135,Exodus 8:17-18,"[Exodus] [ch 8] [verse 17] And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were lice upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. [verse 18] And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: and there were lice upon man, and upon beast."
136,Exodus 8:20-23,"[Exodus] [ch 8] [verse 20] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me. [verse 21] Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon they servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are. [verse 22] And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth. [verse 23] And I will put a division between my people and thy people: by to-morrow shall this sign be."
137,Exodus 8:24,"[Exodus] [ch 8] [verse 24] And Jehovah did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies."
138,Exodus 8:29-31,"[Exodus] [ch 8] [verse 29] And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat Jehovah that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow: only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah. [verse 30] And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah. [verse 31] And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one."
139,Exodus 9:1-5,"[Exodus] [ch 9] [verse 1] Then Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. [verse 2] For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, [verse 3] behold, the hand of Jehovah is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks: [there shall be] a very grievous murrain. [verse 4] And Jehovah shall make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of Israel. [verse 5] And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow Jehovah shall do this thing in the land."
140,Exodus 9:6,[Exodus] [ch 9] [verse 6] And Jehovah did that thing on the morrow; and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
141,Exodus 9:8-9,"[Exodus] [ch 9] [verse 8] And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. [verse 9] And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt."
142,Exodus 9:10-11,"[Exodus] [ch 9] [verse 10] And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast. [verse 11] And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians."
143,Exodus 9:13-19,"[Exodus] [ch 9] [verse 13] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. [verse 14] For I will this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth. [verse 15] For now I had put forth my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou hadst been cut off from the earth: [verse 16] but in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. [verse 17] As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go? [verse 18] Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now. [verse 19] Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field; [for] every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die."
144,Exodus 9:22,"[Exodus] [ch 9] [verse 22] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt."
145,Exodus 9:23-26,"[Exodus] [ch 9] [verse 23] And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down unto the earth; and Jehovah rained hail upon the land of Egypt. [verse 24] So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. [verse 25] And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field. [verse 26] Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail."
146,Exodus 9:29-33,"[Exodus] [ch 9] [verse 29] And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto Jehovah; the thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah's. [verse 30] But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear Jehovah God. [verse 31] And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom. [verse 32] But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten: for they were not grown up. [verse 33] And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto Jehovah: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth."
147,Exodus 10:1-11,"[Exodus] [ch 10] [verse 1] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them, [verse 10] And he said unto them, So be Jehovah with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you. [verse 11] Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve Jehovah; for that is what ye desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence. [verse 2] and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought upon Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know that I am Jehovah. [verse 3] And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me. [verse 4] Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring locusts into thy border: [verse 5] and they shall cover the face of the earth, so that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field: [verse 6] and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh. [verse 7] And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed? [verse 8] And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve Jehovah your God; but who are they that shall go? [verse 9] And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto Jehovah."
148,Exodus 10:12,"[Exodus] [ch 10] [verse 12] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left."
149,Exodus 10:13-15,"[Exodus] [ch 10] [verse 13] And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. [verse 14] And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. [verse 15] For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt."
150,Exodus 10:18-19,"[Exodus] [ch 10] [verse 18] And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah. [verse 19] And Jehovah turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt."
151,Exodus 10:21,"[Exodus] [ch 10] [verse 21] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt."
152,Exodus 10:22-23,"[Exodus] [ch 10] [verse 22] And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days; [verse 23] they saw not one another, neither rose any one from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings."
153,Exodus 11:1-7,"[Exodus] [ch 11] [verse 1] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. [verse 2] Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold. [verse 3] And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people. [verse 4] And Moses said, Thus saith Jehovah, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: [verse 5] and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the first-born of cattle. [verse 6] And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath not been, nor shall be any more. [verse 7] But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that Jehovah doth make a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel."
154,"Exodus 12:1-27, 12:43-49","[Exodus] [ch 12] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, [verse 10] And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. [verse 11] And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is Jehovah's passover. [verse 12] For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am Jehovah. [verse 13] And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. [verse 14] And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah: throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. [verse 15] Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. [verse 16] And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you. [verse 17] And ye shall observe the [feast of] unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance for ever. [verse 18] In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. [verse 19] Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one that is born in the land. [verse 2] This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you. [verse 20] Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread. [verse 21] Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families, and kill the passover. [verse 22] And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning. [verse 23] For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. [verse 24] And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. [verse 25] And it shall come to pass, when ye are come to the land which Jehovah will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. [verse 26] And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? [verse 27] that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of Jehovah's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. [verse 3] Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth [day] of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household: [ [verse 4] and if the household be too little for a lamb, then shall he and his neighbor next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls; according to every man's eating ye shall make your count for the lamb. [verse 43] And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no foreigner eat thereof; [verse 44] but every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. [verse 45] A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof. [verse 46] In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. [verse 47] All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. [verse 48] And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. [verse 49] One law shall be to him that is home-born, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you. [verse 5] Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old: ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats: [verse 6] and ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at even. [verse 7] And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel, upon the houses wherein they shall eat it. [verse 8] And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it. [verse 9] Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof."
155,Exodus 12:29-30,"[Exodus] [ch 12] [verse 29] And it came to pass at midnight, that Jehovah smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle. [verse 30] And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead."
156,Exodus 12:35-36,"[Exodus] [ch 12] [verse 35] And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: [verse 36] and Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they despoiled the Egyptians."
157,Exodus 12:51,"[Exodus] [ch 12] [verse 51] And it came to pass the selfsame day, that Jehovah did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts."
158,Exodus 13:1-2,"[Exodus] [ch 13] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 2] Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine."
159,Exodus 13:17-18,"[Exodus] [ch 13] [verse 17] And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: [verse 18] but God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt."
160,Exodus 13:21-22,"[Exodus] [ch 13] [verse 21] And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; that they might go by day and by night: [verse 22] the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people."
161,Exodus 14:1-4,"[Exodus] [ch 14] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 2] Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon: over against it shall ye encamp by the sea. [verse 3] And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. [verse 4] And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so. ["
162,Exodus 14:15-18,"[Exodus] [ch 14] [verse 15] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward. [verse 16] And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground. [verse 17] And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

163,Exodus 14:19-20,"[Exodus] [ch 14] [verse 19] And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them: [verse 20] and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one came not near the other all the night."
164,Exodus 14:21-22,"[Exodus] [ch 14] [verse 21] And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah caused the sea to go [back] by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

165,Exodus 14:24-25,"[Exodus] [ch 14] [verse 24] And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked forth upon the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians.

173,Exodus 16:13-14,"[Exodus] [ch 16] [verse 13] And it came to pass at even, that the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp. [verse 14] And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoar-frost on the ground."
174,Exodus 16:23-30,"[Exodus] [ch 16] [verse 23] And he said unto them, This is that which Jehovah hath spoken, To-morrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath unto Jehovah: bake that which ye will bake, and boil that which ye will boil; and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. [verse 24] And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm therein. [verse 25] And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath unto Jehovah: to-day ye shall not find it in the field. [verse 26] Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there shall be none. [verse 27] And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people to gather, and they found none. [verse 28] And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? [verse 29] See, for that Jehovah hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. [verse 30] So the people rested on the seventh day."
175,Exodus 16:32-34,"[Exodus] [ch 16] [verse 32] And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. [verse 33] And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations. [verse 34] As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept."
176,Exodus 17:5-6,"[Exodus] [ch 17] [verse 5] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go. [verse 6] Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel."
177,Exodus 17:6,"[Exodus] [ch 17] [verse 6] Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel."
178,Exodus 17:8-13,"[Exodus] [ch 17] [verse 10] So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. [verse 11] And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. [verse 12] But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; And his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. [verse 13] And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. [verse 8] Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. [verse 9] And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand."
179,Exodus 17:14,"[Exodus] [ch 17] [verse 14] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven."
180,Exodus 19:3-6,"[Exodus] [ch 19] [verse 3] And Moses went up unto God, and Jehovah called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: [verse 4] Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. [verse 5] Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be mine own possession from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine: [verse 6] and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel."
181,Exodus 19:9-13,"[Exodus] [ch 19] [verse 10] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments, [verse 11] and be ready against the third day; for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. [verse 12] And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: [verse 13] no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, he shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. [verse 9] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto Jehovah."
182,Exodus 19:16-25,"[Exodus] [ch 19] [verse 16] And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled. [verse 17] And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. [verse 18] And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. [verse 19] And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. [verse 20] And Jehovah came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. [verse 21] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish. [verse 22] And let the priests also, that come near to Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth upon them. [verse 23] And Moses said unto Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. [verse 24] And Jehovah said unto him, Go, get thee down; and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Jehovah, lest he break forth upon them. [verse 25] So Moses went down unto the people, and told them."
183,Exodus 20:1-17,"[Exodus] [ch 20] [verse 1] And God spake all these words, saying, [verse 10] but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: [verse 11] for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. [verse 12] Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee. [verse 13] Thou shalt not kill. [verse 14] Thou shalt not commit adultery. [verse 15] Thou shalt not steal. [verse 16] Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. [verse 17] Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor's. [verse 2] I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. [verse 3] Thou shalt have no other gods before me. [verse 4] Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness [of any thing] that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: [verse 5] thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me, [verse 6] and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. [verse 7] Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. [verse 8] Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. [verse 9] Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;"
184,Exodus 20:22-26,"[Exodus] [ch 20] [verse 22] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. [verse 23] Ye shall not make [other gods] with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you. [verse 24] An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee. [verse 25] And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. [verse 26] Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon."
185,Exodus 21:1-23:19,"[Exodus] [ch 21] [verse 1] Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them. [verse 10] If he take him another [wife] ; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish. [verse 11] And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money. [verse 12] He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death. [verse 13] And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver [him] into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee. [verse 14] And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die. [verse 15] And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death. [verse 16] And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death. [verse 17] And he that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death. [verse 18] And if men contend, and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed; [verse 19] if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed. [verse 2] If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. [verse 20] And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished. [verse 21] Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money. [verse 22] And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow; he shall be surely fined, according as the woman's husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. [verse 23] But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life, [verse 24] eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, [verse 25] burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. [verse 26] And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake. [verse 27] And if he smite out his man-servant's tooth, or his maid-servant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake. [verse 28] And if an ox gore a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit. [verse 29] But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and it hath been testified to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. [verse 3] If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him. [verse 30] If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. [verse 31] Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him. [verse 32] If the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant, there shall be given unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. [verse 33] And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein, [verse 34] the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the owner thereof, and the dead [beast] shall be his. [verse 35] And if one man's ox hurt another's, so that it dieth, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it; and the dead also they shall divide. [verse 36] Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner hath not kept it in; he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead [beast] shall be his own. [verse 4] If his master give him a wife, and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. [verse 5] But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: [verse 6] then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever. [verse 7] And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do. [verse 8] If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. [verse 9] And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. [ch 22] [verse 1] If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep. [verse 10] If a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it: [verse 11] the oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, whether he hath not put his hand unto his neighbor's goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution. [verse 12] But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof. [verse 13] If it be torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness; he shall not make good that which was torn. [verse 14] And if a man borrow aught of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make restitution. [verse 15] If the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be a hired thing, it came for its hire. [verse 16] And if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife. [verse 17] If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins. [verse 18] Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live. [verse 19] Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death. [verse 2] If the thief be found breaking in, and be smitten so that he dieth, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him. [verse 20] He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto Jehovah only, shall be utterly destroyed. [verse 21] And a sojourner shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him: for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt. [verse 22] Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. [verse 23] If thou afflict them at all, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry; [verse 24] and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless. [verse 25] If thou lend money to any of my people with thee that is poor, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest. [verse 26] If thou at all take thy neighbor's garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him before the sun goeth down: [verse 27] for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious. [verse 28] Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse a ruler of thy people. [verse 29] Thou shalt not delay to offer of thy harvest, and of the outflow of thy presses. The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto me. [verse 3] If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him; he shall make restitution: if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. [verse 30] Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, [and] with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me. [verse 31] And ye shall be holy men unto me: therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs. [verse 4] If the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall pay double. [verse 5] If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution. [verse 6] If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution. [verse 7] If a man shall deliver unto his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, he shall pay double. [verse 8] If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near unto God, [to see] whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbor's goods. [verse 9] For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, [or] for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith, This is it, the cause of both parties shall come before God; he whom God shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbor. [ch 23] [verse 1] Thou shalt not take up a false report: put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. [verse 10] And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the increase thereof: [verse 11] but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, [and] with thy oliveyard. [verse 12] Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner, may be refreshed. [verse 13] And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth. [verse 14] Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. [verse 15] The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it thou camest out from Egypt); and none shall appear before me empty: [verse 16] and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labors, which thou sowest in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field. [verse 17] Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord Jehovah. [verse 18] Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning. [verse 19] The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in it mother's milk. [verse 2] Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to wrest [justice] : [verse 3] neither shalt thou favor a poor man in his cause. [verse 4] If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. [verse 5] If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, thou shalt forbear to leave him, thou shalt surely release [it] with him. [verse 6] Thou shalt not wrest the justice [due] to thy poor in his cause. [verse 7] Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked. [verse 8] And thou shalt take no bribe: for a bribe blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous. [verse 9] And a sojourner shalt thou not oppress: for ye know the heart of a sojourner, seeing ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt."
186,Exodus 23:20-33,"[Exodus] [ch 23] [verse 20] Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. [verse 21] Take ye heed before him, and hearken unto his voice; provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgression: for my name is in him. [verse 22] But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. [verse 23] For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: and I will cut them off. [verse 24] Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars. [verse 25] And ye shall serve Jehovah your God, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. [verse 26] There shall none cast her young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil. [verse 27] I will send my terror before thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. [verse 28] And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. [verse 29] I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee. [verse 30] By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land. [verse 31] And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee. [verse 32] Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. [verse 33] They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee."
187,Exodus 24:9-11,"[Exodus] [ch 24] [verse 10] and they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven for clearness. [verse 11] And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: and they beheld God, and did eat and drink. [verse 9] Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:"
188,Exodus 24:12-18,"[Exodus] [ch 24] [verse 12] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayest teach them. [verse 13] And Moses rose up, and Joshua his minister: and Moses went up into the mount of God. [verse 14] And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; whosoever hath a cause, let him come near unto them. [verse 15] And Moses went up into the mount, and the cloud covered the mount. [verse 16] And the glory of Jehovah abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. [verse 17] And the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. [verse 18] And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights."
189,Exodus 25:1-31:18,"[Exodus] [ch 25] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] And they shall make an ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. [verse 11] And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. [verse 12] And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof; and two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. [verse 13] And thou shalt make staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. [verse 14] And thou shalt put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, wherewith to bear the ark. [verse 15] The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it. [verse 16] And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee. [verse 17] And thou shalt make a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half [shall be] the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. [verse 18] And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work shalt thou make them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat. [verse 19] And make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat shall ye make the cherubim on the two ends thereof. [verse 2] Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for me an offering: of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take my offering. [verse 20] And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat shall the faces of the cherubim be. [verse 21] And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. [verse 22] And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel. [verse 23] And thou shalt make a table of acacia wood: two cubits [shall be] the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. [verse 24] And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about. [verse 25] And thou shalt make unto it a border of a handbreadth round about; and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about. [verse 26] And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof. [verse 27] Close by the border shall the rings be, for places for the staves to bear the table. [verse 28] And thou shalt make the staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them. [verse 29] And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and the spoons thereof, and the flagons thereof, and the bowls thereof, wherewith to pour out: of pure gold shalt thou make them. [verse 3] And this is the offering which ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and brass, [verse 30] And thou shalt set upon the table showbread before me alway. [verse 31] And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it: [verse 32] and there shall be six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof: [verse 33] three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the candlestick: [verse 34] and in the candlestick four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof; [verse 35] and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the candlestick. [verse 36] Their knops and their branches shall be of one piece with it; the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold. [verse 37] And thou shalt make the lamps thereof, seven: and they shall light the lamps thereof, to give light over against it. [verse 38] And the snuffers thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold. [verse 39] Of a talent of pure gold shall it be made, with all these vessels. [verse 4] and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' [hair] , [verse 40] And see that thou make them after their pattern, which hath been showed thee in the mount. [verse 5] and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood, [verse 6] oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense, [verse 7] onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate. [verse 8] And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them. [verse 9] According to all that I show thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so shall ye make it. [ch 26] [verse 1] Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim the work of the skilful workman shalt thou make them. [verse 10] And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops upon the edge of the curtain which is [outmost in] the second coupling. [verse 11] And thou shalt make fifty clasps of brass, and put the clasps into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one. [verse 12] And the overhanging part that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the back of the tabernacle. [verse 13] And the cubit on the one side, and the cubit on the other side, of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it. [verse 14] And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above. [verse 15] And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing up. [verse 16] Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board. [verse 17] Two tenons shall there be in each board, joined one to another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle. [verse 18] And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side southward. [verse 19] And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons: [verse 2] The length of each curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits: all the curtains shall have one measure. [verse 20] and for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, twenty boards, [verse 21] and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. [verse 22] And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six boards. [verse 23] And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part. [verse 24] And they shall be double beneath, and in like manner they shall be entire unto the top thereof unto one ring: thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners. [verse 25] And there shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. [verse 26] And thou shalt make bars of acacia wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, [verse 27] and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the hinder part westward. [verse 28] And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall pass through from end to end. [verse 29] And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold. [verse 3] Five curtains shall be coupled together one to another; and [the other] five curtains shall be coupled one to another. [verse 30] And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which hath been showed thee in the mount. [verse 31] And thou shalt make a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim the work of the skilful workman shall it be made: [verse 32] and thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of acacia overlaid with gold; their hooks [shall be] of gold, upon four sockets of silver. [verse 33] And thou shalt hang up the veil under the clasps, and shalt bring in thither within the veil the ark of the testimony: and the veil shall separate unto you between the holy place and the most holy. [verse 34] And thou shalt put the mercy-seat upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy place. [verse 35] And thou shalt set the table without the veil, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on the north side. [verse 36] And thou shalt make a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer. [verse 37] And thou shalt make for the screen five pillars of acacia, and overlay them with gold; their hooks shall be of gold: and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them. [verse 4] And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is outmost in the second coupling. [verse 5] Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the second coupling; the loops shall be opposite one to another. [verse 6] And thou shalt make fifty clasps of gold, and couple the curtains one to another with the clasps: and the tabernacle shall be one [whole] . [verse 7] And thou shalt make curtains of goats' [hair] for a tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make them. [verse 8] The length of each curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits: the eleven curtains shall have one measure. [verse 9] And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shalt double over the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tent. [ch 27] [verse 1] And thou shalt make the altar of acacia wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits. [verse 10] and the pillars thereof shall be twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets [shall be] of silver. [verse 11] And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings a hundred cubits long, and the pillars thereof twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver. [verse 12] And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits; their pillars ten, and their sockets ten. [verse 13] And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall be fifty cubits. [verse 14] The hangings for the one side [of the gate] shall be fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. [verse 15] And for the other side shall be hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. [verse 16] And for the gate of the court shall be a screen of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer; their pillars four, and their sockets four. [verse 17] All the pillars of the court round about shall be filleted with silver; their hooks of silver, and their sockets of brass. [verse 18] The length of the court shall be a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty every where, and the height five cubits, of fine twined linen, and their sockets of brass. [verse 19] All the instruments of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass. [verse 2] And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof; the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it: and thou shalt overlay it with brass. [verse 20] And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually. [verse 21] In the tent of meeting, without the veil which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall keep it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah: it shall be a statue for ever throughout their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel. [verse 3] And thou shalt make its pots to take away its ashes, and its shovels, and its basins, and its flesh-hooks, and its firepans: all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass. [verse 4] And thou shalt make for it a grating of network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brazen rings in the four corners thereof. [verse 5] And thou shalt put it under the ledge round the altar beneath, that the net may reach halfway up the altar. [verse 6] And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with brass. [verse 7] And the staves thereof shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, in bearing it. [verse 8] Hollow with planks shalt thou make it: as it hath been showed thee in the mount, so shall they make it. [verse 9] And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen a hundred cubits long for one side: [ch 28] [verse 1] And bring thou near unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons. [verse 10] six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the six that remain on the other stone, according to their birth. [verse 11] With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones, according to the names of the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be inclosed in settings of gold. [verse 12] And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel: and Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah upon his two shoulders for a memorial. [verse 13] And thou shalt make settings of gold, [verse 14] and two chains of pure gold; like cords shalt thou make them, of wreathen work: and thou shalt put the wreathen chains on the settings. [verse 15] And thou shalt make a breastplate of judgment, the work of the skilful workman; like the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, shalt thou make it. [verse 16] Foursquare it shall be [and] double; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof. [verse 17] And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, four rows of stones: a row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle shall be the first row; [verse 18] and the second row an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond; [verse 19] and the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; [verse 2] And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for glory and for beauty. [verse 20] and the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall be inclosed in gold in their settings. [verse 21] And the stones shall be according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, they shall be for the twelve tribes. [verse 22] And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold. [verse 23] And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. [verse 24] And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate. [verse 25] And the [other] two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod in the forepart thereof. [verse 26] And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which is toward the side of the ephod inward. [verse 27] And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and shalt put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod. [verse 28] And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod. [verse 29] And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before Jehovah continually. [verse 3] And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise-hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they make Aaron's garments to sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. [verse 30] And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before Jehovah: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before Jehovah continually. [verse 31] And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue. [verse 32] And it shall have a hole for the head in the midst thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of a coat of mail, that it be not rent. [verse 33] And upon the skirts of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the skirts thereof; and bells of gold between them round about: [verse 34] a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about. [verse 35] And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and the sound thereof shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before Jehovah, and when he cometh out, that he die not. [verse 36] And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO JEHOVAH. [verse 37] And thou shalt put it on a lace of blue, and it shall be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be. [verse 38] And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, and Aaron shall bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before Jehovah. [verse 39] And thou shalt weave the coat in checker work of fine linen, and thou shalt make a mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make a girdle, the work of the embroiderer. [verse 4] And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a coat of checker work, a mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. [verse 40] And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and head-tires shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty. [verse 41] And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and upon his sons with him, and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office. [ [verse 42] And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach: [verse 43] and they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they go in unto the tent of meeting, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever unto him and unto his seed after him. [verse 5] And they shall take the gold, and the blue, and the purple, and the scarlet, and the fine linen. [verse 6] And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the skilful workman. [verse 7] It shall have two shoulder-pieces joined to the two ends thereof, that it may be joined together. [verse 8] And the skilfully woven band, which is upon it, wherewith to gird it on, shall be like the work thereof [and] of the same piece; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. [verse 9] And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel: [ch 29] [verse 1] And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: take one young bullock and two rams without blemish, [verse 10] And thou shalt bring the bullock before the tent of meeting: and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock. [verse 11] And thou shalt kill the bullock before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting. [verse 12] And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger; and thou shalt pour out all the blood at the base of the altar. [verse 13] And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul upon the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar. [verse 14] But the flesh of the bullock, and its skin, and its dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin-offering. [verse 15] Thou shalt also take the one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram. [verse 16] And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take its blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar. [verse 17] And thou shalt cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards, and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head. [verse 18] And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering unto Jehovah; it is a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. [verse 19] And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram. [verse 2] and unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened mingled with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of fine wheaten flour shalt thou make them. [verse 20] Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of its blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. [verse 21] And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him. [verse 22] Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of consecration), [verse 23] and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before Jehovah: [verse 24] and thou shalt put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and shalt wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah. [verse 25] And thou shalt take them from their hands, and burn them on the altar upon the burnt-offering, for a sweet savor before Jehovah: it is an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. [verse 26] And thou shalt take the breast of Aaron's ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: and it shall be thy portion. [verse 27] And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave-offering, and the thigh of the heave-offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons: [verse 28] and it shall be for Aaron and his sons as [their] portion for ever from the children of Israel; for it is a heave-offering: and it shall be a heave-offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, even their heave-offering unto Jehovah. [verse 29] And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them. [verse 3] And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams. [verse 30] Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead put them on, when he cometh into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place. [verse 31] And thou shalt take the ram of consecration, and boil its flesh in a holy place. [verse 32] And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting. [verse 33] And they shall eat those things wherewith atonement was made, to consecrate [and] to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy. [verse 34] And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy. [verse 35] And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them. [verse 36] And every day shalt thou offer the bullock of sin-offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou makest atonement for it; and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. [verse 37] Seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it: and the altar shall be most holy; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy. [verse 38] Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually. [verse 39] The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even: [verse 4] And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water. [verse 40] and with the one lamb a tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering. [verse 41] And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meal-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering thereof, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. [verse 42] It shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, where I will meet with you, to speak there unto thee. [verse 43] And there I will meet with the children of Israel; and [the Tent] shall be sanctified by my glory. [verse 44] And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar: Aaron also and his sons will I sanctify, to minister to me in the priest's office. [verse 45] And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. [verse 46] And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them: I am Jehovah their God. [verse 5] And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod; [verse 6] and thou shalt set the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre. [verse 7] Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him. [verse 8] And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them. [verse 9] And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and bind head-tires on them: and they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons. [ch 30] [verse 1] And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of acacia wood shalt thou make it. [verse 10] And Aaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it once in the year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once in the year shall he make atonement for it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto Jehovah. [verse 11] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 12] When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to those that are numbered of them, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto Jehovah, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them. [verse 13] This they shall give, every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered: half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel for an offering to Jehovah. [verse 14] Every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of Jehovah. [verse 15] The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls. [verse 16] And thou shalt take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls. [verse 17] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 18] Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, whereat to wash. And thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. [verse 19] And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: [verse 2] A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be; and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it. [verse 20] when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. [verse 21] So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations. [verse 22] Moreover Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 23] Take thou also unto thee the chief spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred [shekels], and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty, [verse 24] and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin; [verse 25] and thou shalt make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing oil. [verse 26] And thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, [verse 27] and the table and all the vessels thereof, and the candlestick and the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense, [verse 28] and the altar of burnt-offering with all the vessels thereof, and the laver and the base thereof. [verse 29] And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. [verse 3] And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. [verse 30] And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office. [verse 31] And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. [verse 32] Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any like it, according to the composition thereof: it is holy, [and] it shall be holy unto you. [verse 33] Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people. [verse 34] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight; [verse 35] and thou shalt make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure [and] holy: [verse 36] and thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy. [verse 37] And the incense which thou shalt make, according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves: it shall be unto thee holy for Jehovah. [verse 38] Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereof, he shall be cut off from his people. [verse 4] And two golden rings shalt thou make for it under the crown thereof; upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make them; and they shall be for places for staves wherewith to bear it. [verse 5] And thou shalt make the staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. [verse 6] And thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. [verse 7] And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of sweet spices: every morning, when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn it. [verse 8] And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations. [verse 9] Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt-offering, nor meal-offering; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon. [ch 31] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] and the finely wrought garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office, [verse 11] and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do. [verse 12] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 13] Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily ye shall keep my sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am Jehovah who sanctifieth you. [verse 14] Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. [verse 15] Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Jehovah; whosoever doeth any work on the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. [verse 16] Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. [verse 17] It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. [verse 18] And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God. [verse 2] See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: [verse 3] and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, [verse 4] to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, [verse 5] and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship. [verse 6] And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee: [verse 7] the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent, [verse 8] and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense, [verse 9] and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base,"
190,"Exodus 31:18, 32:15-16","[Exodus] [ch 31] [verse 18] And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God. [ch 32] [verse 15] And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. [verse 16] And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables."
191,Exodus 32:7-10,"[Exodus] [ch 32] [verse 10] now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. [verse 7] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, that thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: [verse 8] they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed unto it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. [verse 9] And Jehovah said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:"
192,Exodus 32:11-14,"[Exodus] [ch 32] [verse 11] And Moses besought Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, that thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? [verse 12] Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil did he bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. [verse 13] Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. [verse 14] And Jehovah repented of the evil which he said he would do unto his people."
193,Exodus 32:33-34,"[Exodus] [ch 32] [verse 33] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. [verse 34] And now go, lead the people unto [the place] of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine angel shall go before thee; nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them."
194,Exodus 32:35,"[Exodus] [ch 32] [verse 35] And Jehovah smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made."
195,Exodus 33:1-6,"[Exodus] [ch 33] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Depart, go up hence, thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it: [verse 2] and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: [verse 3] unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people; lest I consume thee in the way. [verse 4] And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. [verse 5] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people; if I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. [verse 6] And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward."
196,Exodus 33:9-11,"[Exodus] [ch 33] [verse 10] And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door. [verse 11] And Jehovah spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent. [verse 9] And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent: and [Jehovah] spake with Moses."
197,Exodus 33:12-23,"[Exodus] [ch 33] [verse 12] And Moses said unto Jehovah, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found favor in my sight. [verse 13] Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight, show me now thy ways, that I may know thee, to the end that I may find favor in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people. [verse 14] And he said, My presence shall go [with thee], and I will give thee rest. [verse 15] And he said unto him, If thy presence go not [with me], carry us not up hence. [verse 16] For wherein now shall it be known that I have found favor in thy sight, I and thy people? is it not in that thou goest with us, so that we are separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth? [verse 17] And Jehovah said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken; for thou hast found favor in my sight, and I know thee by name. [verse 18] And he said, Show me, I pray thee, thy glory. [verse 19] And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. [verse 20] And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for man shall not see me and live. [verse 21] And Jehovah said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock: [verse 22] and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand until I have passed by: [verse 23] and I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back; but my face shall not be seen."
198,Exodus 34:1-4,"[Exodus] [ch 34] [verse 1] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou brakest. [verse 2] And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount. [verse 3] And no man shall come up with thee; neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. [verse 4] And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone."
199,Exodus 33:21-34:5,"[Exodus] [ch 33] [verse 21] And Jehovah said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock: [verse 22] and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand until I have passed by: [verse 23] and I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back; but my face shall not be seen. [ch 34] [verse 1] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou brakest. [verse 2] And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount. [verse 3] And no man shall come up with thee; neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. [verse 4] And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone. [verse 5] And Jehovah descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah."
200,Exodus 34:5-7,"[Exodus] [ch 34] [verse 5] And Jehovah descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah. [verse 6] And Jehovah passed by before him, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth; [verse 7] keeping lovingkindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation."
201,Exodus 34:10-28,"[Exodus] [ch 34] [verse 10] And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of Jehovah; for it is a terrible thing that I do with thee. [verse 11] Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. [verse 12] Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: [verse 13] but ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim [verse 14] (for thou shalt worship no other god: for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God); [verse 15] lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot after their gods, and sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice; [verse 16] and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters play the harlot after their gods, and make thy sons play the harlot after their gods. [verse 17] Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. [verse 18] The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. [verse 19] All that openeth the womb is mine; and all thy cattle that is male, the firstlings of cow and sheep. [verse 20] And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty. [verse 21] Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. [verse 22] And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, [even] of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end. [verse 23] Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel. [verse 24] For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou goest up to appear before Jehovah thy God three times in the year. [verse 25] Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. [verse 26] The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring unto the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk. [verse 27] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. [verse 28] And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments."
202,Exodus 34:29-35,"[Exodus] [ch 34] [verse 29] And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him. [verse 30] And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. [verse 31] And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses spake to them. [verse 32] And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him in mount Sinai. [verse 33] And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face. [verse 34] But when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. [verse 35] And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone; and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him."
203,Exodus 35:30-35,"[Exodus] [ch 35] [verse 30] And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, Jehovah hath called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; [verse 31] and he hath filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; [verse 32] and to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, [verse 33] and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of skilful workmanship. [verse 34] And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. [verse 35] Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the engraver, and of the skilful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any workmanship, and of those that devise skilful works."
204,Exodus 40:1-15,"[Exodus] [ch 40] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar shall be most holy. [verse 11] And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it. [verse 12] And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water. [verse 13] And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. [verse 14] And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them; [verse 15] and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: and their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. [verse 2] On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. [verse 3] And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and thou shalt screen the ark with the veil. [verse 4] And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. [verse 5] And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle. [verse 6] And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. [verse 7] And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water therein. [verse 8] And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court. [verse 9] And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the furniture thereof: and it shall be holy."
205,Exodus 40:34-38,"[Exodus] [ch 40] [verse 34] Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle. [verse 35] And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle. [verse 36] And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys: [verse 37] but if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. [verse 38] For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys."
206,Exodus 40:36-38,"[Exodus] [ch 40] [verse 36] And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys: [verse 37] but if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. [verse 38] For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys."
207,Leviticus 1:1-17,"[Leviticus] [ch 1] [verse 1] And Jehovah called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying, [verse 10] And if his oblation be of the flock, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering; he shall offer it a male without blemish. [verse 11] And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before Jehovah: and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about. [verse 12] And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: [verse 13] but the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water. And the priest shall offer the whole, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. [verse 14] And if his oblation to Jehovah be a burnt-offering of birds, then he shall offer his oblation of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons. [verse 15] And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar; [verse 16] and he shall take away its crop with the filth thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes: [verse 17] and he shall rend it by the wings thereof, [but] shall not divide it asunder. And the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. [verse 2] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man of you offereth an oblation unto Jehovah, ye shall offer your oblation of the cattle, [even] of the herd and of the flock. [verse 3] If his oblation be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish: he shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before Jehovah. [verse 4] And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. [verse 5] And he shall kill the bullock before Jehovah: and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting. [verse 6] And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces. [verse 7] And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire; [verse 8] and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: [verse 9] but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water. And the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
208,Leviticus 2:1-16,"[Leviticus] [ch 2] [verse 1] And when any one offereth an oblation of a meal-offering unto Jehovah, his oblation shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon: [verse 10] And that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire. [verse 11] No meal-offering, which ye shall offer unto Jehovah, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. [verse 12] As an oblation of first-[ fruits] ye shall offer them unto Jehovah: but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar. [verse 13] And every oblation of thy meal-offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal-offering: with all thine oblations thou shalt offer salt. [verse 14] And if thou offer a meal-offering of first-fruits unto Jehovah, thou shalt offer for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear. [verse 15] And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meal-offering. [verse 16] And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the bruised grain thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. [verse 2] and he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof. And the priest shall burn [it as] the memorial thereof upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah: [verse 3] and that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire. [verse 4] And when thou offerest an oblation of a meal-offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. [verse 5] And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the baking-pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. [verse 6] Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meal-offering. [verse 7] And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. [verse 8] And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto Jehovah: and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar. [verse 9] And the priest shall take up from the meal-offering the memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
209,Leviticus 3:1-17,"[Leviticus] [ch 3] [verse 1] And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace-offerings; if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before Jehovah. [verse 10] and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away. [verse 11] And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto Jehovah. [verse 12] And if his oblation be a goat, then he shall offer it before Jehovah: [verse 13] and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about. [verse 14] And he shall offer thereof his oblation, [even] an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, [verse 15] and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away. [verse 16] And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savor; all the fat is Jehovah's. [verse 17] It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood. [verse 2] And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. [verse 3] And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, [verse 4] and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away. [verse 5] And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt-offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. [verse 6] And if his oblation for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. [verse 7] If he offer a lamb for his oblation, then shall he offer it before Jehovah; [verse 8] and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it before the tent of meeting: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about. [verse 9] And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, he shall take away hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,"
210,Leviticus 4:1-5:13,"[Leviticus] [ch 4] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt-offering. [verse 11] And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung, [verse 12] even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt. [verse 13] And if the whole congregation of Israel err, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and are guilty; [verse 14] when the sin wherein they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting. [verse 15] And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before Jehovah; and the bullock shall be killed before Jehovah. [verse 16] And the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting: [verse 17] and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before Jehovah, before the veil. [verse 18] And he shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before Jehovah, that is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting. [verse 19] And all the fat thereof shall he take off from it, and burn it upon the altar. [verse 2] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any one shall sin unwittingly, in any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and shall do any one of them: [verse 20] Thus shall he do with the bullock; as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven. [verse 21] And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock: it is the sin-offering for the assembly. [verse 22] When a ruler sinneth, and doeth unwittingly any one of all the things which Jehovah his God hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty; [verse 23] if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be made known to him, he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a male without blemish. [verse 24] And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before Jehovah: it is a sin-offering. [verse 25] And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering. [verse 26] And all the fat thereof shall he burn upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he shall be forgiven. [verse 27] And if any one of the common people sin unwittingly, in doing any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and be guilty; [verse 28] if his sin, which he hath sinned, be made known to him, then he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned. [verse 29] And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering. [verse 3] if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto Jehovah for a sin-offering. [verse 30] And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar. [verse 31] And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor unto Jehovah; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven. [verse 32] And if he bring a lamb as his oblation for a sin-offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish. [verse 33] And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering. [verse 34] And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar. [verse 35] And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; and the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven. [verse 4] And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah; and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and kill the bullock before Jehovah. [verse 5] And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock, and bring it to the tent of meeting: [verse 6] and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Jehovah, before the veil of the sanctuary. [verse 7] And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Jehovah, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bullock shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting. [verse 8] And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he shall take off from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, [verse 9] and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away, [ch 5] [verse 1] And if any one sin, in that he heareth the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he hath seen or known, if he do not utter [it], then he shall bear his iniquity. [verse 10] And he shall offer the second for a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven. [ [verse 11] But if his means suffice not for two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his oblation for that wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering: he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon; for it is a sin-offering. [verse 12] And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: it is a sin-offering. [verse 13] And the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in any of these things, and he shall be forgiven: and [the remnant] shall be the priest's, as the meal-offering. [verse 2] Or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and it be hidden from him, and he be unclean, then he shall be guilty. [verse 3] Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever his uncleanness be wherewith he is unclean, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty. [verse 4] Or if any one swear rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter rashly with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these [things] . [verse 5] And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these [things], that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned: [verse 6] and he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin. [verse 7] And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass-offering for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, unto Jehovah; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering. [verse 8] And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it asunder: [verse 9] and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin-offering."
211,Leviticus 5:14-6:7,"[Leviticus] [ch 5] [verse 14] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 15] If any one commit a trespass, and sin unwittingly, in the holy things of Jehovah; then he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering: [verse 16] and he shall make restitution for that which he hath done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and he shall be forgiven. [verse 17] And if any one sin, and do any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. [verse 18] And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the thing wherein he erred unwittingly and knew it not, and he shall be forgiven. [verse 19] It is a trespass-offering: he is certainly guilty before Jehovah. [ch 6] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 2] If any one sin, and commit a trespass against Jehovah, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of bargain, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor, [verse 3] or have found that which was lost, and deal falsely therein, and swear to a lie; in any of all these things that a man doeth, sinning therein; [verse 4] then it shall be, if he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he hath gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found, [verse 5] or any thing about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more thereto: unto him to whom it appertaineth shall he give it, in the day of his being found guilty. [verse 6] And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest: [verse 7] and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah; and he shall be forgiven concerning whatsoever he doeth so as to be guilty thereby."
212,Leviticus 6:8-7:38,"[Leviticus] [ch 6] [verse 10] And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. [verse 11] And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. [verse 12] And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereon, it shall not go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning: and he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it, and shall burn thereon the fat of the peace-offerings. [verse 13] Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out. [verse 14] And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before Jehovah, before the altar. [verse 15] And he shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor, as the memorial thereof, unto Jehovah. [verse 16] And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it. [verse 17] It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the trespass-offering. [verse 18] Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as [his] portion for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: whosoever toucheth them shall be holy. [verse 19] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 20] This is the oblation of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto Jehovah in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening. [verse 21] On a baking-pan it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, thou shalt bring it in: in baken pieces shalt thou offer the meal-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah. [verse 22] And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it: by a statute for ever it shall be wholly burnt unto Jehovah. [verse 23] And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten. [verse 24] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 25] Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before Jehovah: it is most holy. [verse 26] The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting. [verse 27] Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place. [verse 28] But the earthen vessel wherein it is boiled shall be broken; and if it be boiled in a brazen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water. [verse 29] Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy. [verse 30] And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt with fire. [verse 8] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 9] Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt-offering: the burnt-offering shall be on the hearth upon the altar all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereon. [ch 7] [verse 1] And this is the law of the trespass-offering: it is most holy. [verse 10] And every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another. [verse 11] And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which one shall offer unto Jehovah. [verse 12] If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked. [verse 13] With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his oblation with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving. [verse 14] And of it he shall offer one out of each oblation for a heave-offering unto Jehovah; it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace-offerings. [verse 15] And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his oblation; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. [verse 16] But if the sacrifice of his oblation be a vow, or a freewill-offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offereth his sacrifice; and on the morrow that which remaineth of it shall be eaten: [verse 17] but that which remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire. [verse 18] And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity. [verse 19] And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, every one that is clean shall eat thereof: [verse 2] In the place where they kill the burnt-offering shall they kill the trespass-offering; and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle upon the altar round about. [verse 20] but the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people. [verse 21] And when any one shall touch any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean beast, or any unclean abomination, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which pertain unto Jehovah, that soul shall be cut off from his people. [verse 22] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 23] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat. [verse 24] And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it. [verse 25] For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. [verse 26] And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of bird or of beast, in any of your dwellings. [verse 27] Whosoever it be that eateth any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people. [verse 28] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 29] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace-offerings unto Jehovah shall bring his oblation unto Jehovah out of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings: [verse 3] And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof: the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, [verse 30] his own hands shall bring the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah. [verse 31] And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar; but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'. [verse 32] And the right thigh shall ye give unto the priest for a heave-offering out of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings. [verse 33] He among the sons of Aaron that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion. [verse 34] For the wave-breast and the heave - thigh have I taken of the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as [their] portion for ever from the children of Israel. [verse 35] This is the anointing-portion of Aaron, and the anointing-portion of his sons, out of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto Jehovah in the priest's office; [verse 36] which Jehovah commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them. It is [their] portion for ever throughout their generations. [verse 37] This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the trespass-offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; [verse 38] which Jehovah commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto Jehovah, in the wilderness of Sinai. [verse 4] and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away; [verse 5] and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a trespass-offering. [verse 6] Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in a holy place: it is most holy. [verse 7] As is the sin-offering, so is the trespass-offering; there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith, he shall have it. [verse 8] And the priest that offereth any man's burnt-offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered. [verse 9] And every meal-offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying-pan, and on the baking-pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it."
213,Leviticus 8:1-5,"[Leviticus] [ch 8] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 2] Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread; [verse 3] and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting. [verse 4] And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting. [verse 5] And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded to be done."
214,Leviticus 9:24,"[Leviticus] [ch 9] [verse 24] And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces."
215,Leviticus 10:1-2,"[Leviticus] [ch 10] [verse 1] And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which he had not commanded them. [verse 2] And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and devoured them, and they died before Jehovah."
216,Leviticus 10:3,"[Leviticus] [ch 10] [verse 3] Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that Jehovah spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace."
217,Leviticus 10:8-11,"[Leviticus] [ch 10] [verse 10] and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean; [verse 11] and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah hath spoken unto them by Moses. [verse 8] And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, saying, [verse 9] Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:"
218,Leviticus 11:1-47,"[Leviticus] [ch 11] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, [verse 10] And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination unto you, [verse 11] and they shall be an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination. [verse 12] Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an abomination unto you. [verse 13] And these ye shall have in abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray, [verse 14] and the kite, and the falcon after its kind, [verse 15] every raven after its kind, [verse 16] and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kind, [verse 17] and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, [verse 18] and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture, [verse 19] and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat. [verse 2] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. [verse 20] All winged creeping things that go upon all fours are an abomination unto you. [verse 21] Yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all fours, which have legs above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth. [verse 22] Even these of them ye may eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind. [verse 23] But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are an abomination unto you. [verse 24] And by these ye shall become unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even; [verse 25] And whosoever beareth [aught] of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. [verse 26] Every beast which parteth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean. [verse 27] And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours, they are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the even. [verse 28] And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you. [verse 29] And these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind, [verse 3] Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, [and] cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat. [verse 30] and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon. [verse 31] These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even. [verse 32] And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherewith any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean. [verse 33] And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and it ye shall break. [verse 34] All food [therein] which may be eaten, that on which water cometh, shall be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every [such] vessel shall be unclean. [verse 35] And every thing whereupon [any part] of their carcass falleth shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces: they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you. [verse 36] Nevertheless a fountain or a pit wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean. [verse 37] And if [aught] of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean. [verse 38] But if water be put upon the seed, and [aught] of their carcass fall thereon, it is unclean unto you. [verse 39] And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even. [verse 4] Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that part the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you. [verse 40] And he that eateth of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. [verse 41] And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten. [verse 42] Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all fours, or whatsoever hath many feet, even all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination. [verse 43] Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby. [verse 44] For I am Jehovah your God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moveth upon the earth. [verse 45] For I am Jehovah that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy. [verse 46] This is the law of the beast, and of the bird, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth; [verse 47] to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten. [verse 5] And the coney, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you. [verse 6] And the hare, because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, she is unclean unto you. [verse 7] And the swine, because he parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you. [verse 8] Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch; they are unclean unto you. [verse 9] These may ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that may ye eat."
219,Leviticus 12:1-8,"[Leviticus] [ch 12] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 2] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman conceive seed, and bear a man-child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean. [verse 3] And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. [verse 4] And she shall continue in the blood of [her] purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled. [verse 5] But if she bear a maid-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity; and she shall continue in the blood of [her] purifying threescore and six days. [verse 6] And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb a year old for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest: [verse 7] and he shall offer it before Jehovah, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that beareth, whether a male or a female. [verse 8] And if her means suffice not for a lamb, then she shall take two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons; the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean."
220,Leviticus 13:1-59,"[Leviticus] [ch 13] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, [verse 10] and the priest shall look; and, behold, if there be a white rising in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising, [verse 11] it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean. [verse 12] And if the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of [him that hath] the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appeareth to the priest; [verse 13] then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce [him] clean [that hath] the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean. [verse 14] But whensoever raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean. [verse 15] And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy. [verse 16] Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, then he shall come unto the priest; [verse 17] and the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the plague be turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce [him] clean [that hath] the plague: he is clean. [verse 18] And when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a boil, and it is healed, [verse 19] and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then is shall be showed to the priest; [verse 2] When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests: [verse 20] and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy, it hath broken out in the boil. [verse 21] But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: [verse 22] And if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague. [verse 23] But if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. [verse 24] Or when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a burning by fire, and the quick [flesh] of the burning become a bright spot, reddish-white, or white; [verse 25] then the priest shall look upon it; and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin; it is leprosy, it hath broken out in the burning: and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. [verse 26] But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: [verse 27] and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. [verse 28] And if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread in the skin, but be dim; it is the rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is the scar of the burning. [verse 29] And when a man or woman hath a plague upon the head or upon the beard, [verse 3] and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and if the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean. [verse 30] then the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and there be in it yellow thin hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard. [verse 31] And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the plague of the scall seven days: [verse 32] And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the scall be not spread, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall be not deeper than the skin, [verse 33] then he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the scall seven days more: [verse 34] and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. [verse 35] But if the scall spread abroad in the skin after his cleansing, [verse 36] then the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean. [verse 37] But if in his eyes the scall be at a stay, and black hair be grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean. [verse 38] And when a man or a woman hath in the skin of the flesh bright spots, even white bright spots; [verse 39] then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be of a dull white, it is a tetter, it hath broken out in the skin; he is clean. [verse 4] And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, then the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the plague seven days: [verse 40] And if a man's hair be fallen off his head, he is bald; [yet] is he clean. [verse 41] And if his hair be fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald; [yet] is he clean. [verse 42] But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead. [verse 43] Then the priest shall look upon him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague be reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh; [verse 44] he is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his plague is in his head. [verse 45] And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean. [verse 46] All the days wherein the plague is in him he shall be unclean; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be. [verse 47] The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment; [verse 48] whether it be in warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin; [verse 49] if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be showed unto the priest. [verse 5] and the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if in his eyes the plague be at a stay, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more: [verse 50] And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up [that which hath] the plague seven days: [verse 51] and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean. [verse 52] And he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in woollen or in linen, or anything of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire. [verse 53] And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; [verse 54] then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more: [verse 55] and the priest shall look, after that the plague is washed; and, behold, if the plague have not changed its color, and the plague be not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire: it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without. [verse 56] And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be dim after the washing thereof, then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: [verse 57] and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is breaking out: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire. [verse 58] And the garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean. [verse 59] This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or anything of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean. [verse 6] and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague be dim, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. [verse 7] But if the scab spread abroad in the skin, after that he hath showed himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again: [verse 8] and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the scab be spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy. [verse 9] When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;"
221,Leviticus 14:1-57,"[Leviticus] [ch 14] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish, and three tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil. [verse 11] And the priest that cleanseth him shall set the man that is to be cleansed, and those things, before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting. [verse 12] And the priest shall take one of the he-lambs, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah: [verse 13] and he shall kill the he-lamb in the place where they kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the sanctuary: for as the sin-offering is the priest's, so is the trespass-offering: it is most holy: [verse 14] and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. [verse 15] And the priest shall take of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand; [verse 16] and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah: [verse 17] and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass-offering: [verse 18] and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah. [verse 19] And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement for him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness: and afterward he shall kill the burnt-offering; [verse 2] This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought unto the priest: [verse 20] and the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean. [verse 21] And if he be poor, and cannot get so much, then he shall take one he-lamb for a trespass-offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering, and a log of oil; [verse 22] and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering. [verse 23] And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tent of meeting, before Jehovah: [verse 24] and the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah. [verse 25] And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass-offering; and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. [verse 26] And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand; [verse 27] and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before Jehovah: [verse 28] and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass-offering: [verse 29] and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before Jehovah. [verse 3] and the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper, [verse 30] And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, such as he is able to get, [verse 31] even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, with the meal-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed before Jehovah. [verse 32] This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, who is not able to get [that which pertaineth] to his cleansing. [verse 33] And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, [verse 34] When ye are come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession; [verse 35] then he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, There seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house. [verse 36] And the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goeth in to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house: [verse 37] and he shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and the appearance thereof be lower than the wall; [verse 38] then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days. [verse 39] And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house; [verse 4] then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: [verse 40] then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is, and cast them into an unclean place without the city: [verse 41] and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scrape off, without the city into an unclean place: [verse 42] and they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house. [verse 43] And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken out the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plastered; [verse 44] then the priest shall come in and look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean. [verse 45] And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place. [verse 46] Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even. [verse 47] And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. [verse 48] And if the priest shall come in, and look, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered; then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed. [verse 49] And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: [verse 5] And the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water. [verse 50] and he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water: [verse 51] and he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times: [verse 52] and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet: [verse 53] but he shall let got the living bird out of the city into the open field: so shall he make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean. [verse 54] This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and for a scall, [verse 55] and for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house, [verse 56] and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot; [verse 57] to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy. [verse 6] As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water: [verse 7] And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let go the living bird into the open field. [verse 8] And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days. [verse 9] And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and he shall be clean."
222,Leviticus 15:1-33,"[Leviticus] [ch 15] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying, [verse 10] And whosoever toucheth anything that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. [verse 11] And whomsoever he that hath the issue toucheth, without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. [verse 12] And the earthen vessel, which he that hath the issue toucheth, shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water. [verse 13] And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean. [verse 14] And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come before Jehovah unto the door of the tent of meeting, and give them unto the priest: [verse 15] and the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah for his issue. [verse 16] And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even. [verse 17] And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even. [verse 18] The woman also with whom a man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even. [verse 19] And if a woman have an issue, [and] her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even. [verse 2] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath an issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean. [verse 20] And everything that she lieth upon in her impurity shall be unclean: everything also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean. [verse 21] And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. [verse 22] And whosoever toucheth anything that she sitteth upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. [verse 23] And if it be on the bed, or on anything whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even. [verse 24] And if any man lie with her, and her impurity be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean. [verse 25] And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days not in the time of her impurity, or if she have an issue beyond the time of her impurity; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness she shall be as in the days of her impurity: she is unclean. [verse 26] Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her impurity: and everything whereon she sitteth shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her impurity. [verse 27] And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. [verse 28] But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean. [verse 29] And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting. [verse 3] And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness. [verse 30] And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her before Jehovah for the issue of her uncleanness. [verse 31] Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness, that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is in the midst of them. [verse 32] This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed of copulation goeth from him, so that he is unclean thereby; [verse 33] and of her that is sick with her impurity, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean. [verse 4] Every bed whereon he that hath the issue lieth shall be unclean; and everything whereon he sitteth shall be unclean. [verse 5] And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. [verse 6] And he that sitteth on anything whereon he that hath the issue sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. [verse 7] And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. [verse 8] And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. [verse 9] And what saddle soever he that hath the issue rideth upon shall be unclean."
223,Leviticus 16:1-34,"[Leviticus] [ch 16] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before Jehovah, and died; [verse 10] But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive before Jehovah, to make atonement for him, to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness. [verse 11] And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself: [verse 12] and he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil: [verse 13] and he shall put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not: [verse 14] and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy-seat on the east; and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times. [verse 15] Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat: [verse 16] and he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins: and so shall he do for the tent of meeting, that dwelleth with them in the midst of their uncleannesses. [verse 17] And there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel. [verse 18] And he shall go out unto the altar that is before Jehovah, and make atonement for it, and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about. [verse 19] And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel. [verse 2] and Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat. [verse 20] And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat: [verse 21] and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a man that is in readiness into the wilderness: [verse 22] and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a solitary land: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness. [verse 23] And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there: [verse 24] and he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people. [verse 25] And the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar. [verse 26] And he that letteth go the goat for Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp. [verse 27] And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be carried forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung. [verse 28] And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp. [verse 29] And it shall be a statute for ever unto you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and shall do no manner of work, the home-born, or the stranger that sojourneth among you: [verse 3] Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering. [verse 30] for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before Jehovah. [verse 31] It is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; it is a statute for ever. [verse 32] And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments: [verse 33] and he shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary; and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly. [verse 34] And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make atonement for the children of Israel because of all their sins once in the year. And he did as Jehovah commanded Moses. [verse 4] He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: they are the holy garments; and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on. [verse 5] And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two he-goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering. [verse 6] And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house. [verse 7] And he shall take the two goats, and set them before Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting. [verse 8] And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for Jehovah, and the other lot for Azazel. [verse 9] And Aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for Jehovah, and offer him for a sin-offering."
224,Leviticus 17:1-16,"[Leviticus] [ch 17] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood, I will set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people. [verse 11] For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life. [verse 12] Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. [verse 13] And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who taketh in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten; he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust. [verse 14] For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is [all one] with the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh; for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off. [verse 15] And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean. [verse 16] But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity. [verse 2] Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, saying, [verse 3] What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without the camp, [verse 4] and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it as an oblation unto Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah: blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people: [verse 5] To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offerings unto Jehovah. [verse 6] And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet savor unto Jehovah. [verse 7] And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the he-goats, after which they play the harlot. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations. [verse 8] And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt-offering or sacrifice, [verse 9] and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it unto Jehovah; that man shall be cut off from his people."
225,Leviticus 18:1-30,"[Leviticus] [ch 18] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness. [verse 11] The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. [verse 12] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman. [verse 13] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman. [verse 14] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt. [verse 15] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. [verse 16] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness. [verse 17] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen: it is wickedness. [verse 18] And thou shalt not take a wife to her sister, to be a rival [to her], to uncover her nakedness, besides the other in her life-time. [verse 19] And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness. [verse 2] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am Jehovah your God. [verse 20] And thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbor's wife, to defile thyself with her. [verse 21] And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to make them pass through [the fire] to Molech; neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am Jehovah. [verse 22] Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination. [verse 23] And thou shalt not lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto: it is confusion. [verse 24] Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out from before you; [verse 25] And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants. [verse 26] Ye therefore shall keep my statutes and mine ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the home-born, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you; [verse 27] (for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you, and the land is defiled); [verse 28] that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you. [verse 29] For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people. [verse 3] After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their statutes. [verse 30] Therefore shall ye keep my charge, that ye practise not any of these abominable customs, which were practised before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am Jehovah your God. [verse 4] Mine ordinances shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am Jehovah your God. [verse 5] Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and mine ordinances; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am Jehovah. [verse 6] None of you shall approach to any that are near of kin to him, to uncover [their] nakedness: I am Jehovah. [verse 7] The nakedness of thy father, even the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. [verse 8] The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness. [verse 9] The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover."
226,Leviticus 19:1-37,"[Leviticus] [ch 19] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God. [verse 11] Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another. [verse 12] And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, and profane the name of thy God: I am Jehovah. [verse 13] Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor, nor rob him: the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning. [verse 14] Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind; but thou shalt fear thy God: I am Jehovah. [verse 15] Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor. [verse 16] Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor: I am Jehovah. [verse 17] Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbor, and not bear sin because of him. [verse 18] Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people; but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am Jehovah. [verse 19] Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed: neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together. [verse 2] Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy; for I Jehovah your God am holy. [verse 20] And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. [verse 21] And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a trespass-offering. [verse 22] And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned: and the sin which he hath sinned shall be forgiven him. [verse 23] And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision: three years shall they be as uncircumcised unto you; it shall not be eaten. [verse 24] But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto Jehovah. [verse 25] And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am Jehovah your God. [verse 26] Ye shall not eat anything with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantments, nor practise augury. [verse 27] Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. [verse 28] Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am Jehovah. [verse 29] Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness. [verse 3] Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father; and ye shall keep my sabbaths: I am Jehovah your God. [verse 30] Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary; I am Jehovah. [verse 31] Turn ye not unto them that have familiar spirits, nor unto the wizards; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am Jehovah your God. [verse 32] Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and thou shalt fear thy God: I am Jehovah. [verse 33] And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong. [verse 34] The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God. [verse 35] Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity. [verse 36] Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. [verse 37] And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them: I am Jehovah. [verse 4] Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am Jehovah your God. [verse 5] And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted. [verse 6] It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire. [verse 7] And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it shall not be accepted: [verse 8] but every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of Jehovah: and that soul shall be cut off from his people. [verse 9] And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest."
227,Leviticus 20:1-27,"[Leviticus] [ch 20] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. [verse 11] And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. [verse 12] And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them. [verse 13] And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. [verse 14] And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you. [verse 15] And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast. [verse 16] And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. [verse 17] And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity. [verse 18] And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath made naked her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people. [verse 19] And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister; for he hath made naked his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity. [verse 2] Moreover, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones. [verse 20] And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless. [verse 21] And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is impurity: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless. [verse 22] Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them; that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out. [verse 23] And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. [verse 24] But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am Jehovah your God, who hath separated you from the peoples. [verse 25] Ye shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by bird, or by anything wherewith the ground teemeth, which I have separated from you as unclean. [verse 26] And ye shall be holy unto me: for I, Jehovah, am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be mine. [verse 27] A man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them. [verse 3] I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. [verse 4] And if the people at the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and put him not to death; [verse 5] then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that play the harlot after him, to play the harlot with Molech, from among their people. [verse 6] And the soul that turneth unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto the wizards, to play the harlot after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. [verse 7] Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am Jehovah your God. [verse 8] And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth you. [verse 9] For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him."
228,Leviticus 21:1-24,"[Leviticus] [ch 21] [verse 1] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people; [verse 10] And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes; [verse 11] neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; [verse 12] neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am Jehovah. [verse 13] And he shall take a wife in her virginity. [verse 14] A widow, or one divorced, or a profane woman, a harlot, these shall he not take: but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife. [verse 15] And he shall not profane his seed among his people: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth him. [verse 16] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 17] Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God. [verse 18] For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or anything superfluous, [verse 19] or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed, [verse 2] except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother, [verse 20] or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or is scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; [verse 21] no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God. [verse 22] He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy: [verse 23] only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them. [verse 24] So Moses spake unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel. [verse 3] and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that hath had no husband; for her may he defile himself. [verse 4] He shall not defile himself, [being] a chief man among his people, to profane himself. [verse 5] They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. [verse 6] They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God; for the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy. [verse 7] They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God. [verse 8] Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I Jehovah, who sanctify you, am holy. [verse 9] And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the harlot, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire."
229,Leviticus 22:1-33,"[Leviticus] [ch 22] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest's, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing. [verse 11] But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread. [verse 12] And if a priest's daughter be married unto a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things. [verse 13] But if a priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and be returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's bread: but there shall no stranger eat thereof. [verse 14] And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing. [verse 15] And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto Jehovah, [verse 16] and [so] cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them. [verse 17] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 18] Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, that offereth his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offerings, which they offer unto Jehovah for a burnt-offering; [verse 19] that ye may be accepted, [ye shall offer] a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats. [verse 2] Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto me, and that they profane not my holy name: I am Jehovah. [verse 20] But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you. [verse 21] And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein. [verse 22] Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto Jehovah, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto Jehovah. [verse 23] Either a bullock or a lamb that hath anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted. [verse 24] That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, ye shall not offer unto Jehovah; neither shall ye do [thus] in your land. [verse 25] Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them: they shall not be accepted for you. [verse 26] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 27] When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. [verse 28] And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day. [verse 29] And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto Jehovah, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted. [verse 3] Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before me: I am Jehovah. [verse 30] On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am Jehovah. [verse 31] Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am Jehovah. [verse 32] And ye shall not profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am Jehovah who halloweth you, [verse 33] who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah. [verse 4] What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him; [verse 5] or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; [verse 6] the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water. [verse 7] And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread. [verse 8] That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat, to defile himself therewith: I am Jehovah. [verse 9] They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them."
230,Leviticus 23:1-44,"[Leviticus] [ch 23] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest: [verse 11] and he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. [verse 12] And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah. [verse 13] And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah for a sweet savor; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin. [verse 14] And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. [verse 15] And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven sabbaths shall there be complete: [verse 16] even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah. [verse 17] Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth parts [of an ephah] : they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baken with leaven, for first-fruits unto Jehovah. [verse 18] And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt-offering unto Jehovah, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. [verse 19] And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings. [verse 2] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts. [verse 20] And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before Jehovah, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to Jehovah for the priest. [verse 21] And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no servile work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations. [verse 22] And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God. [verse 23] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 24] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation. [verse 25] Ye shall do no servile work; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. [verse 26] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 27] Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. [verse 28] And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God. [verse 29] For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day; he shall be cut off from his people. [verse 3] Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work: it is a sabbath unto Jehovah in all your dwellings. [verse 30] And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people. [verse 31] Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. [verse 32] It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath. [verse 33] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 34] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto Jehovah. [verse 35] On the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work. [verse 36] Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a solemn assembly; ye shall do no servile work. [verse 37] These are the set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day; [verse 38] besides the sabbaths of Jehovah, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto Jehovah. [verse 39] Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest. [verse 4] These are the set feasts of Jehovah, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season. [verse 40] And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God seven days. [verse 41] And ye shall keep it a feast unto Jehovah seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month. [verse 42] Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths; [verse 43] that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God. [verse 44] And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the set feasts of Jehovah. [verse 5] In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is Jehovah's passover. [verse 6] And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto Jehovah: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread. [verse 7] In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work. [verse 8] But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah seven days: in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work. [verse 9] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
231,Leviticus 24:1-4,"[Leviticus] [ch 24] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 2] Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually. [verse 3] Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah continually: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations. [verse 4] He shall keep in order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before Jehovah continually."
232,Leviticus 24:5-9,"[Leviticus] [ch 24] [verse 5] And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts [of an ephah] shall be in one cake. [verse 6] And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before Jehovah. [verse 7] And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. [verse 8] Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before Jehovah continually; it is on the behalf of the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant. [verse 9] And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire by a perpetual statute."
233,Leviticus 24:13-16,"[Leviticus] [ch 24] [verse 13] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 14] Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him. [verse 15] And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. [verse 16] And he that blasphemeth the name of Jehovah, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemeth the name [of Jehovah], shall be put to death."
234,Leviticus 24:17-22,"[Leviticus] [ch 24] [verse 17] And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death. [verse 18] And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life. [verse 19] And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him: [verse 20] breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him. [verse 21] And he that killeth a beast shall make it good: and he that killeth a man shall be put to death. [verse 22] Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the sojourner, as for the home-born: for I am Jehovah your God."
235,Leviticus 25:1-55,"[Leviticus] [ch 25] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, [verse 10] And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. [verse 11] A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather [the grapes] in it of the undressed vines. [verse 12] For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field. [verse 13] In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession. [verse 14] And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy of thy neighbor's hand, ye shall not wrong one another. [verse 15] According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbor, [and] according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee. [verse 16] According to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for the number of the crops doth he sell unto thee. [verse 17] And ye shall not wrong one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am Jehovah your God. [verse 18] Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep mine ordinances and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. [verse 19] And the land shall yield its fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety. [verse 2] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto Jehovah. [verse 20] And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase; [verse 21] then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years. [verse 22] And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, ye shall eat the old store. [verse 23] And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for ye are strangers and sojourners with me. [verse 24] And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land. [verse 25] If thy brother be waxed poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold. [verse 26] And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it; [verse 27] then let him reckon the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return unto his possession. [verse 28] But if he be not able to get it back for himself, then that which he hath sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession. [verse 29] And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption. [verse 3] Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruits thereof; [verse 30] And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee. [verse 31] But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee. [verse 32] Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time. [verse 33] And if one of the Levites redeem, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel. [verse 34] But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession. [verse 35] And if thy brother be waxed poor, and his hand fail with thee; then thou shalt uphold him: [as] a stranger and a sojourner shall he live with thee. [verse 36] Take thou no interest of him or increase, but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee. [verse 37] Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor give him thy victuals for increase. [verse 38] I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, [and] to be your God. [verse 39] And if thy brother be waxed poor with thee, and sell himself unto thee; thou shalt not make him to serve as a bond-servant. [verse 4] but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath unto Jehovah: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. [verse 40] As a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubilee: [verse 41] then shall he go out from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return. [verse 42] For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen. [verse 43] Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God. [verse 44] And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou shalt have; of the nations that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. [verse 45] Moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land: and they shall be your possession. [verse 46] And ye shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them shall ye take your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigor. [verse 47] And if a stranger or sojourner with thee be waxed rich, and thy brother be waxed poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger [or] sojourner with thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family; [verse 48] after that he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brethren may redeem him; [verse 49] or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxed rich, he may redeem himself. [verse 5] That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather: it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land. [verse 50] And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him. [verse 51] If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. [verse 52] And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption. [verse 53] As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight. [verse 54] And if he be not redeemed by these [means], then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him. [verse 55] For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God. [verse 6] And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger, who sojourn with thee. [verse 7] And for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be for food. [verse 8] And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and there shall be unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years. [verse 9] Then shalt thou send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall ye send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land."
236,Leviticus 26:1-10,"[Leviticus] [ch 26] [verse 1] Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am Jehovah your God. [verse 10] And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new. [verse 2] Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am Jehovah. [verse 3] If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; [verse 4] then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. [verse 5] And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. [verse 6] And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. [verse 7] And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. [verse 8] And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. [verse 9] And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you."
237,Leviticus 26:11-12,"[Leviticus] [ch 26] [verse 11] And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. [verse 12] And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people."
238,Leviticus 26:14-39,"[Leviticus] [ch 26] [verse 14] But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; [verse 15] and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant; [verse 16] I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. [verse 17] And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. [verse 18] And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins. [verse 19] And I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass; [verse 20] and your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit. [verse 21] And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. [verse 22] And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate. [verse 23] And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me; [verse 24] then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins. [verse 25] And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. [verse 26] When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. [verse 27] And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; [verse 28] then I will walk contrary unto you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins. [verse 29] And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. [verse 30] And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you. [verse 31] And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors. [verse 32] And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it. [verse 33] And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste. [verse 34] Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths. [verse 35] As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. [verse 36] And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. [verse 37] And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. [verse 38] And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. [verse 39] And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them."
239,Leviticus 26:40-46,"[Leviticus] [ch 26] [verse 40] And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary unto me, [verse 41] I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity; [verse 42] then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. [verse 43] The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes. [verse 44] And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God; [verse 45] but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah. [verse 46] These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by Moses."
240,Leviticus 27:1-34,"[Leviticus] [ch 27] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy. [verse 11] And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation unto Jehovah, then he shall set the beast before the priest; [verse 12] and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be. [verse 13] But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy estimation. [verse 14] And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto Jehovah, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand. [verse 15] And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his. [verse 16] And if a man shall sanctify unto Jehovah part of the field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the sowing thereof: the sowing of a homer of barley [shall be valued] at fifty shekels of silver. [verse 17] If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand. [verse 18] But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation. [verse 19] And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him. [verse 2] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall accomplish a vow, the persons shall be for Jehovah by thy estimation. [verse 20] And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more: [verse 21] but the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto Jehovah, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's. [verse 22] And if he sanctify unto Jehovah a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession; [verse 23] then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation unto the year of jubilee: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto Jehovah. [verse 24] In the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth. [verse 25] And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel. [verse 26] Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to Jehovah, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is Jehovah's. [verse 27] And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thine estimation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation. [verse 28] Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto Jehovah of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto Jehovah. [verse 29] No one devoted, that shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death. [verse 3] And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. [verse 30] And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovah's: it is holy unto Jehovah. [verse 31] And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof. [verse 32] And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto Jehovah. [verse 33] He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed. [verse 34] These are the commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai. [verse 4] And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. [verse 5] And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. [verse 6] And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. [verse 7] And if it be from sixty years old and upward; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. [verse 8] But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him that vowed shall the priest value him. [verse 9] And if it be a beast, whereof men offer an oblation unto Jehovah, all that any man giveth of such unto Jehovah shall be holy."
241,Numbers 1:1-54,"[Numbers] [ch 1] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, [verse 10] Of the children of Joseph: Of Ephraim: Elishama the son of Ammihud. Of Manasseh: Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. [verse 11] Of Benjamin: Abidan the son of Gideoni. [verse 12] Of Dan: Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. [verse 13] Of Asher: Pagiel the son of Ochran. [verse 14] Of Gad: Eliasaph the son of Deuel. [verse 15] Of Naphtali: Ahira the son of Enan. [verse 16] These are they that were called of the congregation, the princes of the tribes of their fathers; they were the heads of the thousands of Israel. [verse 17] And Moses and Aaron took these men that are mentioned by name: [verse 18] And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month; and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls. [verse 19] As Jehovah commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai. [verse 2] Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, every male, by their polls; [verse 20] And the children of Reuben, Israel's first-born, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; [verse 21] those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Reuben, were forty and six thousand and five hundred. [verse 22] Of the children of Simeon, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, those that were numbered thereof, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; [verse 23] those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Simeon, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred. [verse 24] Of the children of Gad, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; [verse 25] those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Gad, were forty and five thousand six hundred and fifty. [verse 26] Of the children of Judah, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; [verse 27] those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Judah, were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred. [verse 28] Of the children of Issachar, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; [verse 29] those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Issachar, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred. [verse 3] from twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel, thou and Aaron shall number them by their hosts. [verse 30] Of the children of Zebulun, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; [verse 31] those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Zebulun, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred. [verse 32] Of the children of Joseph, [namely], of the children of Ephraim, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; [verse 33] those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Ephraim, were forty thousand and five hundred. [verse 34] Of the children of Manasseh, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; [verse 35] those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Manasseh, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred. [verse 36] Of the children of Benjamin, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; [verse 37] those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Benjamin, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred. [verse 38] Of the children of Dan, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; [verse 39] those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Dan, were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred. [verse 4] And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of his fathers' house. [verse 40] Of the children of Asher, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; [verse 41] those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Asher, were forty and one thousand and five hundred. [verse 42] Of the children of Naphtali, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; [verse 43] those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Naphtali, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred. [verse 44] These are they that were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: they were each one for his fathers' house. [verse 45] So all they that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers' houses, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel; [verse 46] even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. [verse 47] But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them. [verse 48] For Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 49] Only the tribe of Levi thou shalt not number, neither shalt thou take the sum of them among the children of Israel; [verse 5] And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you. Of Reuben: Elizur the son of Shedeur. [verse 50] but appoint thou the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all the furniture thereof, and over all that belongeth to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the furniture thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle. [verse 51] And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. [verse 52] And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their hosts. [verse 53] But the Levites shall encamp round about the tabernacle of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony. [verse 54] Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did they. [verse 6] Of Simeon: Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. [verse 7] Of Judah: Nahshon the son of Amminadab. [verse 8] Of Issachar: Nethanel the son of Zuar. [verse 9] Of Zebulun: Eliab the son of Helon."
242,Numbers 2:1-34,"[Numbers] [ch 2] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, [verse 10] On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur. [verse 11] And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty and six thousand and five hundred. [verse 12] And those that encamp next unto him shall be the tribe of Simeon: and the prince of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. [verse 13] And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.

[verse 33] But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses. [verse 34] Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so they encamped by their standards, and so they set forward, every one by their families, according to their fathers' houses. [verse 4] And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.

243,Numbers 3:5-51,"[Numbers] [ch 3] [verse 10] And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall keep their priesthood: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. [verse 11] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 12] And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the first-born that openeth the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine: [verse 13] for all the first-born are mine; on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the first-born in Israel, both man and beast; mine they shall be: I am Jehovah. [verse 14] And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, [verse 15] Number the children of Levi by their fathers' houses, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. [verse 16] And Moses numbered them according to the word of Jehovah, as he was commanded. [verse 17] And these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. [verse 18] And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei. [verse 19] And the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram, and Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. [verse 20] And the sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their fathers' houses. [verse 21] Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimeites: these are the families of the Gershonites. [verse 22] Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred. [verse 23] The families of the Gershonites shall encamp behind the tabernacle westward. [verse 24] And the prince of the fathers' house of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael. [verse 25] And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting shall be the tabernacle, and the Tent, the covering thereof, and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting, [verse 26] and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof. [verse 27] And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the Kohathites. [verse 28] According to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, there were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary. [verse 29] The families of the sons of Kohath shall encamp on the side of the tabernacle southward. [verse 30] And the prince of the fathers' house of the families of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel. [verse 31] And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the screen, and all the service thereof. [verse 32] And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be prince of the princes of the Levites, [and have] the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary. [verse 33] Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.

[verse 35] And the prince of the fathers' house of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: they shall encamp on the side of the tabernacle northward. [verse 36] And the appointed charge of the sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the instruments thereof, and all the service thereof, [verse 37] and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords. [verse 38] And those that encamp before the tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrising, shall be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. [verse 39] All that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of Jehovah, by their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand. [verse 40] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Number all the first-born males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names. [verse 41] And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am Jehovah) instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel: [verse 42] and Moses numbered, as Jehovah commanded him, all the first-born among the children of Israel. [verse 43] And all the first-born males according to the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen. [verse 44] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 45] Take the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am Jehovah. [verse 46] And for the redemption of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the first-born of the children of Israel, that are over and above [the number of] the Levites, [verse 47] thou shalt take five shekels apiece by the poll; after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them (the shekel is twenty gerahs): [verse 48] and thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons. [verse 49] And Moses took the redemption-money from them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites; [verse 5] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 50] from the first-born of the children of Israel took he the money, a thousand three hundred and threescore and five [shekels], after the shekel of the sanctuary: [verse 51] and Moses gave the redemption-money unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of Jehovah, as Jehovah commanded Moses. [verse 6] Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him. [verse 7] And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle. [verse 8] And they shall keep all the furniture of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. [verse 9] And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are wholly given unto him on the behalf of the children of Israel."
244,Numbers 4:1-49,"[Numbers] [ch 4] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, [verse 10] and they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of sealskin, and shall put it upon the frame. [verse 11] And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of sealskin, and shall put in the staves thereof: [verse 12] and they shall take all the vessels of ministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of sealskin, and shall put them on the frame. [verse 13] And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon: [verse 14] and they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, the firepans, the flesh-hooks, and the shovels, and the basins, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of sealskin, and put in the staves thereof. [verse 15] And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the furniture of the sanctuary, as the camp is set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch the sanctuary, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting. [verse 16] And the charge of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the continual meal-offering, and the anointing oil, the charge of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, the sanctuary, and the furniture thereof. [verse 17] And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, [verse 18] Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites; [verse 19] but thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden; [verse 2] Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers' houses, [verse 20] but they shall not go in to see the sanctuary even for a moment, lest they die. [verse 21] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 22] Take the sum of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers' houses, by their families; [verse 23] from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; all that enter in to wait upon the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting. [verse 24] This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in bearing burdens: [verse 25] they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tent of meeting, its covering, and the covering of sealskin that is above upon it, and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting, [verse 26] and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and whatsoever shall be done with them: therein shall they serve. [verse 27] At the commandment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burden, and in all their service; and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burden. [verse 28] This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting: and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. [verse 29] As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them by their families, by their fathers' houses; [verse 3] from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter upon the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting. [verse 30] from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one that entereth upon the service, to do the work of the tent of meeting. [verse 31] And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tent of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, [verse 32] and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service: and by name ye shall appoint the instruments of the charge of their burden. [verse 33] This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service, in the tent of meeting, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. [verse 34] And Moses and Aaron and the princes of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families, and by their fathers' houses, [verse 35] from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entered upon the service, for work in the tent of meeting: [verse 36] and those that were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty. [verse 37] These are they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, all that did serve in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses. [verse 38] And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, their families, and by their fathers' houses, [verse 39] from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entered upon the service, for work in the tent of meeting, [verse 4] This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, [about] the most holy things: [verse 40] even those that were numbered of them, by their families, by their fathers' houses, were two thousand and six hundred and thirty. [verse 41] These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, all that did serve in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Jehovah. [verse 42] And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, by their families, by their fathers' houses, [verse 43] from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entered upon the service, for work in the tent of meeting, [verse 44] even those that were numbered of them by their families, were three thousand and two hundred. [verse 45] These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses. [verse 46] All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel numbered, by their families, and by their fathers' houses, [verse 47] from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entered in to do the work of service, and the work of bearing burdens in the tent of meeting, [verse 48] even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore. [verse 49] According to the commandment of Jehovah they were numbered by Moses, every one according to his service, and according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as Jehovah commanded Moses. [ [verse 5] when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall go in, and his sons, and they shall take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of the testimony with it, [verse 6] and shall put thereon a covering of sealskin, and shall spread over it a cloth all of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof. [verse 7] And upon the table of showbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls and the cups wherewith to pour out; and the continual bread shall be thereon: [verse 8] and they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of sealskin, and shall put in the staves thereof. [verse 9] And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and its lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it:"
245,Numbers 5:1-4,"[Numbers] [ch 5] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 2] Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is unclean by the dead: [verse 3] both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camp, in the midst whereof I dwell. [verse 4] And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp; as Jehovah spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel."
246,Numbers 5:5-10,"[Numbers] [ch 5] [verse 10] And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his. [verse 5] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 6] Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against Jehovah, and that soul shall be guilty; [verse 7] then he shall confess his sin which he hath done: and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him in respect of whom he hath been guilty. [verse 8] But if the man have no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made unto Jehovah shall be the priest's; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him. [verse 9] And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present unto the priest, shall be his."
247,Numbers 5:11-31,"[Numbers] [ch 5] [verse 11] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 12] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him, [verse 13] and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, and she be not taken in the act; [verse 14] and the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled: [verse 15] then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and shall bring her oblation for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is a meal-offering of jealousy, a meal-offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance. [verse 16] And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before Jehovah: [verse 17] and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water. [verse 18] And the priest shall set the woman before Jehovah, and let the hair of the woman's head go loose, and put the meal-offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal-offering of jealousy: and the priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that causeth the curse. [verse 19] And the priest shall cause her to swear, and shall say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou have not gone aside to uncleanness, being under thy husband, be thou free from this water of bitterness that causeth the curse. [verse 20] But if thou have gone aside, being under thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee besides thy husband: [verse 21] then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, Jehovah make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when Jehovah doth make thy thigh to fall away, and thy body to swell; [verse 22] and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, and make thy body to swell, and thy thigh to fall away. And the woman shall say, Amen, Amen. [verse 23] And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness: [verse 24] and he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causeth the curse; and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her [and become] bitter. [verse 25] And the priest shall take the meal-offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the meal-offering before Jehovah, and bring it unto the altar: [verse 26] and the priest shall take a handful of the meal-offering, as the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water. [verse 27] And when he hath made her drink the water, then it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and have committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her [and become] bitter, and her body shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away: and the woman shall be a curse among her people. [verse 28] And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed. [verse 29] This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goeth aside, and is defiled; [verse 30] or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon a man, and he is jealous of his wife; then shall he set the woman before Jehovah, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law. [verse 31] And the man shall be free from iniquity, and that woman shall bear her iniquity."
248,Numbers 6:1-21,"[Numbers] [ch 6] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting: [verse 11] and the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day. [verse 12] And he shall separate unto Jehovah the days of his separation, and shall bring a he-lamb a year old for a trespass-offering; but the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled. [verse 13] And this is the law of the Nazirite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tent of meeting: [verse 14] and he shall offer his oblation unto Jehovah, one he-lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings, [verse 15] and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings. [verse 16] And the priest shall present them before Jehovah, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering: [verse 17] and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof. [verse 18] And the Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offerings. [verse 19] And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite, after he hath shaven [the head of] his separation; [verse 2] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself unto Jehovah, [verse 20] and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah; this is holy for the priest, together with the wave-breast and heave- thigh: and after that the Nazirite may drink wine. [verse 21] This is the law of the Nazirite who voweth, [and of] his oblation unto Jehovah for his separation, besides that which he is able to get: according to his vow which he voweth, so he must do after the law of his separation. [verse 3] he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried. [verse 4] All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the kernels even to the husk. [verse 5] All the days of his vow of separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in which he separateth himself unto Jehovah, he shall be holy; he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long. [verse 6] All the days that he separateth himself unto Jehovah he shall not come near to a dead body. [verse 7] He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his separation unto God is upon his head. [verse 8] All the days of his separation he is holy unto Jehovah. [verse 9] And if any man die very suddenly beside him, and he defile the head of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it."
249,Numbers 6:22-27,"[Numbers] [ch 6] [verse 22] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 23] Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel: ye shall say unto them, [verse 24] Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee: [verse 25] Jehovah make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: [verse 26] Jehovah lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. [verse 27] So shall they put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them."
250,Numbers 7:1-89,"[Numbers] [ch 7] [verse 1] And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them and sanctified them; [verse 10] And the princes offered for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their oblation before the altar. [verse 11] And Jehovah said unto Moses, They shall offer their oblation, each prince on his day, for the dedication of the altar. [verse 12] And he that offered his oblation the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah: [verse 13] and his oblation was one silver platter, the weight whereof was a hundred and thirty [shekels], one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering; [verse 14] one golden spoon of ten [shekels], full of incense; [verse 15] one young bullock, one ram, one he-lamb a year old, for a burnt-offering; [verse 16] one male of the goats for a sin-offering; [verse 17] and for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, two oxen, five rams, five he-goats, five he-lambs a year old: this was the oblation of Nahshon the son of Amminadab. [verse 18] On the second day Nethanel the son of Zuar, prince of Issachar, did offer: [verse 19] he offered for his oblation one silver platter, the weight whereof was a hundred and thirty [shekels], one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering; [verse 2] that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes, these are they that were over them that were numbered: [verse 20] one golden spoon of ten [shekels], full of incense; [verse 21] one young bullock, one ram, one he-lamb a year old, for a burnt-offering; [verse 22] one male of the goats for a sin-offering; [verse 23] and for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, two oxen, five rams, five he-goats, five he-lambs a year old: this was the oblation of Nethanel the son of Zuar.

[verse 3] And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof [so as to give light] in front of the candlestick, as Jehovah commanded Moses. [verse 4] And this was the work of the candlestick, beaten work of gold; unto the base thereof, [and] unto the flowers thereof, it was beaten work: according unto the pattern which Jehovah had showed Moses, so he made the candlestick."
253,Numbers 8:5-26,"[Numbers] [ch 8] [verse 10] and thou shalt present the Levites before Jehovah. And the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites: [verse 11] and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Jehovah for a wave-offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Jehovah. [verse 12] And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and offer thou the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, unto Jehovah, to make atonement for the Levites. [verse 13] And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for a wave-offering unto Jehovah. [verse 14] Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine. [verse 15] And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tent of meeting: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for a wave-offering. [verse 16] For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me. [verse 17] For all the first-born among the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself. [verse 18] And I have taken the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel. [verse 19] And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary. [verse 20] Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the Levites: according unto all that Jehovah commanded Moses touching the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them. [verse 21] And the Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes: and Aaron offered them for a wave-offering before Jehovah; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them. [verse 22] And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons: as Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them. [verse 23] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 24] This is that which belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service in the work of the tent of meeting: [verse 25] and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the work, and shall serve no more, [verse 26] but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charges. [verse 5] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 6] Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. [verse 7] And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves. [verse 8] Then let them take a young bullock, and its meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering. [verse 9] And thou shalt present the Levites before the tent of meeting: and thou shalt assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel:"
254,Numbers 9:1-14,"[Numbers] [ch 9] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, [verse 10] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto Jehovah. [verse 11] In the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs: [verse 12] they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it. [verse 13] But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he offered not the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. [verse 14] And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him that is born in the land. [verse 2] Moreover let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season. [verse 3] In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it. [verse 4] And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. [verse 5] And they kept the passover in the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. [verse 6] And there were certain men, who were unclean by reason of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: [verse 7] and those men said unto him, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season among the children of Israel? [verse 8] And Moses said unto them, Stay ye, that I may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you. [verse 9] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
255,Numbers 9:15-23,"[Numbers] [ch 9] [verse 15] And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning. [verse 16] So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night. [verse 17] And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped. [verse 18] At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Jehovah they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped. [verse 19] And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and journeyed not. [verse 20] And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Jehovah they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed. [verse 21] And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed: or [if it continued] by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. [verse 22] Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed. [verse 23] At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed: they kept the charge of Jehovah, at the commandment of Jehovah by Moses."
256,Numbers 10:1-10,"[Numbers] [ch 10] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am Jehovah your God. [verse 2] Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them: and thou shalt use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps. [verse 3] And when they shall blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting. [verse 4] And if they blow but one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee. [verse 5] And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey. [verse 6] And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys. [verse 7] But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm. [verse 8] And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations. [verse 9] And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies."
257,Numbers 10:11-28,"[Numbers] [ch 10] [verse 11] And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony. [verse 12] And the children of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran. [verse 13] And they first took their journey according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses. [verse 14] And in the first [place] the standard of the camp of the children of Judah set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab. [verse 15] And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar. [verse 16] And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon. [verse 17] And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bare the tabernacle, set forward.

[verse 21] And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and [the others] did set up the tabernacle against their coming. [verse 22] And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud. [verse 23] And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

258,"Numbers 11:1-3, 11:10","[Numbers] [ch 11] [verse 1] And the people were as murmurers, [speaking] evil in the ears of Jehovah: and when Jehovah heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of Jehovah burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp. [verse 10] And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.

[verse 17] And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone. [verse 18] And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. [verse 19] Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days, [verse 20] but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt? [verse 21] And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. [verse 22] Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them? [verse 23] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Is Jehovah's hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not. [verse 24] And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Jehovah: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent.

[verse 27] And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.

I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. [verse 28] Say unto them, As I live, saith Jehovah, surely as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: [verse 29] your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, that have murmured against me, [verse 30] surely ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. [verse 31] But your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected. [verse 32] But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness. [verse 33] And your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness. [verse 34] After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my alienation. [verse 35] I, Jehovah, have spoken, surely this will I do unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die."
275,Numbers 14:36-37,"[Numbers] [ch 14] [verse 36] And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land, [verse 37] even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Jehovah."
276,Numbers 14:39-45,"[Numbers] [ch 14] [verse 39] And Moses told these words unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. [verse 40] And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up unto the place which Jehovah hath promised: for we have sinned. [verse 41] And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of Jehovah, seeing it shall not prosper? [verse 42] Go not up, for Jehovah is not among you; that ye be not smitten down before your enemies. [verse 43] For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned back from following Jehovah, therefore Jehovah will not be with you. [verse 44] But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. [verse 45] Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who dwelt in that mountain, and smote them and beat them down, even unto Hormah."
277,Numbers 15:1-31,"[Numbers] [ch 15] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] and thou shalt offer for the drink-offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. [verse 11] Thus shall it be done for each bullock, or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids. [verse 12] According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number. [verse 13] All that are home-born shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. [verse 14] And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah; as ye do, so he shall do. [verse 15] For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth [with you], a statute for ever throughout your generations: as ye are, so shall the sojourner be before Jehovah. [verse 16] One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you. [verse 17] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 18] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you, [verse 19] then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave-offering unto Jehovah. [verse 2] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you, [verse 20] Of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for a heave-offering: as the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it. [verse 21] Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto Jehovah a heave-offering throughout your generations. [verse 22] And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses, [verse 23] even all that Jehovah hath commanded you by Moses, from the day that Jehovah gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations; [verse 24] then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah, with the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof, according to the ordinance, and one he-goat for a sin-offering. [verse 25] And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, and their sin-offering before Jehovah, for their error: [verse 26] and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly. [verse 27] And if one person sin unwittingly, then he shall offer a she-goat a year old for a sin-offering. [verse 28] And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth, when he sinneth unwittingly, before Jehovah, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven. [verse 29] Ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly, for him that is home-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them. [verse 3] and will make an offering by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill-offering, or in your set feasts, to make a sweet savor unto Jehovah, of the herd, or of the flock; [verse 30] But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, the same blasphemeth Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. [verse 31] Because he hath despised the word of Jehovah, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him. [verse 4] then shall he that offereth his oblation offer unto Jehovah a meal-offering of a tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil: [verse 5] and wine for the drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin, shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb. [verse 6] Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meal-offering two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil: [verse 7] and for the drink-offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. [verse 8] And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace-offerings unto Jehovah; [verse 9] then shall he offer with the bullock a meal-offering of three tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil:"
278,Numbers 15:32-36,"[Numbers] [ch 15] [verse 32] And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day. [verse 33] And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. [verse 34] And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him. [verse 35] And Jehovah said unto Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. [verse 36] And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
279,Numbers 15:37-41,"[Numbers] [ch 15] [verse 37] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 38] Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each border a cord of blue: [verse 39] and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of Jehovah, and do them; and that ye follow not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to play the harlot; [verse 40] that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. [verse 41] I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah your God."
280,Numbers 16:20-21,"[Numbers] [ch 16] [verse 20] And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, [verse 21] Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment."
281,Numbers 16:31-33,"[Numbers] [ch 16] [verse 31] And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them; [verse 32] and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. [verse 33] So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly."
282,Numbers 16:31-33,"[Numbers] [ch 16] [verse 31] And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them; [verse 32] and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. [verse 33] So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly."
283,Numbers 16:35,"[Numbers] [ch 16] [verse 35] And fire came forth from Jehovah, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense."
284,Numbers 16:36-40,"[Numbers] [ch 16] [verse 36] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 37] Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are holy, [verse 38] even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before Jehovah; therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel. [verse 39] And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar, [verse 40] to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, that is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to burn incense before Jehovah; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as Jehovah spake unto him by Moses."
285,Numbers 16:42,"[Numbers] [ch 16] [verse 42] And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared."
286,Numbers 16:44-45,"[Numbers] [ch 16] [verse 44] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 45] Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces."
287,Numbers 16:46-47,"[Numbers] [ch 16] [verse 46] And Moses said unto Aaron, Take thy censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah; the plague is begun. [verse 47] And Aaron took as Moses spake, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people."
288,Numbers 16:47-48,"[Numbers] [ch 16] [verse 47] And Aaron took as Moses spake, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people. [verse 48] And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed."
289,Numbers 16:49,"[Numbers] [ch 16] [verse 49] Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah."
290,Numbers 17:1-9,"[Numbers] [ch 17] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 2] Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod. [verse 3] And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses. [verse 4] And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you. [verse 5] And it shall come to pass, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you. [verse 6] And Moses spake unto the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. [verse 7] And Moses laid up the rods before Jehovah in the tent of the testimony. [verse 8] And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bare ripe almonds. [verse 9] And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod."
291,Numbers 17:8,"[Numbers] [ch 17] [verse 8] And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bare ripe almonds."
292,Numbers 17:10,"[Numbers] [ch 17] [verse 10] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that thou mayest make an end of their murmurings against me, that they die not."
293,Numbers 18:1-32,"[Numbers] [ch 18] [verse 1] And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy fathers' house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. [verse 10] As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof; every male shall eat thereof: it shall be holy unto thee. [verse 11] And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof. [verse 12] All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give unto Jehovah, to thee have I given them. [verse 13] The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto Jehovah, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof. [verse 14] Everything devoted in Israel shall be thine. [verse 15] Everything that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto Jehovah, both of man and beast shall be thine: nevertheless the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem. [verse 16] And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs). [verse 17] But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah. [verse 18] And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine. [verse 19] All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto Jehovah, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before Jehovah unto thee and to thy seed with thee. [verse 2] And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony. [verse 20] And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. [verse 21] And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting. [verse 22] And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die. [verse 23] But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. [verse 24] For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering unto Jehovah, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. [verse 25] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 26] Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe. [verse 27] And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress. [verse 28] Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering unto Jehovah of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give Jehovah's heave-offering to Aaron the priest. [verse 29] Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of Jehovah, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it. [verse 3] And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye. [verse 30] Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be reckoned unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press. [verse 31] And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting. [verse 32] And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best thereof: and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not. [verse 4] And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you. [verse 5] And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel. [verse 6] And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given unto Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting. [verse 7] And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and ye shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. [verse 8] And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a portion for ever. [verse 9] This shall be thine of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons."
294,Numbers 19:1-22,"[Numbers] [ch 19] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, [verse 10] And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever. [verse 11] He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days: [verse 12] the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. [verse 13] Whosoever toucheth a dead person, the body of a man that hath died, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him. [verse 14] This is the law when a man dieth in a tent: every one that cometh into the tent, and every one that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. [verse 15] And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean. [verse 16] And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. [verse 17] And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin-offering; and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel: [verse 18] and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave: [verse 19] and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even. [verse 2] This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, [and] upon which never came yoke. [verse 20] But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah: the water for impurity hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean. [verse 21] And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them: and he that sprinkleth the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he that toucheth the water for impurity shall be unclean until even. [verse 22] And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even. [verse 3] And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face: [verse 4] and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times. [verse 5] And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn: [verse 6] and the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. [verse 7] Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even. [verse 8] And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. [verse 9] And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin-offering."
295,Numbers 20:7-8,"[Numbers] [ch 20] [verse 7] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 8] Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink."
296,Numbers 20:11,"[Numbers] [ch 20] [verse 11] And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle."
297,Numbers 20:12,"[Numbers] [ch 20] [verse 12] And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed not in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them."
298,Numbers 20:22-26,"[Numbers] [ch 20] [verse 22] And they journeyed from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor. [verse 23] And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying, [verse 24] Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah. [verse 25] Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor; [verse 26] and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered [unto his people], and shall die there."
299,Numbers 21:3,"[Numbers] [ch 21] [verse 3] And Jehovah hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah."
300,Numbers 21:6,"[Numbers] [ch 21] [verse 6] And Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died."
301,Numbers 21:8,"[Numbers] [ch 21] [verse 8] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live."
302,Numbers 21:9,"[Numbers] [ch 21] [verse 9] And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the standard: and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived."
303,Numbers 21:21-32,"[Numbers] [ch 21] [verse 21] And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, [verse 22] Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed thy border. [verse 23] And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel. [verse 24] And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. [verse 25] And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof. [verse 26] For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon. [verse 27] Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come ye to Heshbon; Let the city of Sihon be built and established: [verse 28] For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon: It hath devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon. [verse 29] Woe to thee, Moab! Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: He hath given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, Unto Sihon king of the Amorites. [verse 30] We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, And we have laid waste even unto Nophah, Which [reacheth] unto Medeba. [verse 31] Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. [verse 32] And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there."
304,Numbers 21:33-35,"[Numbers] [ch 21] [verse 33] And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. [verse 34] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon. [verse 35] So they smote him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land."
305,Numbers 22:9-12,"[Numbers] [ch 22] [verse 10] And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, [saying] , [verse 11] Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth: now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.

Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him. [verse 23] And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. [verse 24] Then the angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side. [verse 25] And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again. [verse 26] And the angel of Jehovah went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. [verse 27] And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff. [verse 28] And Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? [verse 29] And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me, I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee.

[verse 34] And Balaam said unto the angel of Jehovah, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again. [verse 35] And the angel of Jehovah said unto Balaam, Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak."

[verse 8] How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah hath not defied?

[ch 24] [verse 15] And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith; [verse 16] He saith, who heareth the words of God, And knoweth the knowledge of the Most High, Who seeth the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open: [verse 17] I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not nigh: There shall come forth a star out of Jacob, And a sceptre shall rise out of Israel, And shall smite through the corners of Moab, And break down all the sons of tumult. [verse 18] And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession, [who were] his enemies; While Israel doeth valiantly. [verse 19] And out of Jacob shall one have dominion, And shall destroy the remnant from the city.

[verse 7] And on the tenth day of this seventh month ye shall have a holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall do no manner of work; [verse 8] but ye shall offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah for a sweet savor: one young bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old; they shall be unto you without blemish; [verse 9] and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram, [ch 30] [verse 1] And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded. [verse 10] And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath, [verse 11] and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. [verse 12] But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and Jehovah will forgive her. [verse 13] Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. [verse 14] But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he hath established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. [verse 15] But if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity. [verse 16] These are the statutes, which Jehovah commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father's house. [verse 2] When a man voweth a vow unto Jehovah, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. [verse 3] Also when a woman voweth a vow unto Jehovah, and bindeth herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth, [verse 4] and her father heareth her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. [verse 5] But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth, none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and Jehovah will forgive her, because her father disallowed her. [verse 6] And if she be [married] to a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul, [verse 7] and her husband hear it, and hold his peace at her in the day that he heareth it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. [verse 8] But if her husband disallow her in the day that he heareth it, then he shall make void her vow which is upon her, and the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul: and Jehovah will forgive her. [verse 9] But the vow of a widow, or of her that is divorced, [even] everything wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand against her."
326,Numbers 31:1-2,"[Numbers] [ch 31] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 2] Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people."
327,Numbers 31:7-11,"[Numbers] [ch 31] [verse 10] And all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire. [verse 11] And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast. [verse 7] And they warred against Midian, as Jehovah commanded Moses; and they slew every male. [verse 8] And they slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword. [verse 9] And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey."
328,Numbers 31:25-54,"[Numbers] [ch 31] [verse 25] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 26] Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the congregation; [verse 27] and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation. [verse 28] And levy a tribute unto Jehovah of the men of war that went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, [both] of the persons, and of the oxen, and of the asses, and of the flocks: [verse 29] take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for Jehovah's heave-offering. [verse 30] And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the asses, and of the flocks, [even] of all the cattle, and give them unto the Levites, that keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah. [verse 31] And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Jehovah commanded Moses. [verse 32] Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, [verse 33] and threescore and twelve thousand oxen, [verse 34] and threescore and one thousand asses, [verse 35] and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of the women that had not known man by lying with him. [verse 36] And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep: [verse 37] and Jehovah's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen. [verse 38] And the oxen were thirty and six thousand; of which Jehovah's tribute was threescore and twelve. [verse 39] And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which Jehovah's tribute was threescore and one. [verse 40] And the persons were sixteen thousand; of whom Jehovah's tribute was thirty and two persons. [verse 41] And Moses gave the tribute, which was Jehovah's heave-offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah commanded Moses. [verse 42] And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided off from the men that warred [verse 43] (now the congregation's half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred sheep, [verse 44] and thirty and six thousand oxen, [verse 45] and thirty thousand and five hundred asses, [verse 46] and sixteen thousand persons), [verse 47] even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, that kept the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses. [verse 48] And the officers that were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses; [verse 49] and they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us. [verse 50] And we have brought Jehovah's oblation, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, ankle-chains, and bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and armlets, to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah. [verse 51] And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels. [verse 52] And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered up to Jehovah, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. [verse 53] ([ For] the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.) [verse 54] And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah."
329,Numbers 33:1-49,"[Numbers] [ch 33] [verse 1] These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their hosts under the hand of Moses and Aaron. [verse 10] And they journeyed from Elim, and encamped by the Red Sea. [verse 11] And they journeyed from the Red Sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin. [verse 12] And they journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah. [verse 13] And they journeyed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.

[verse 37] And they journeyed from Kadesh, and encamped in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom. [verse 38] And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of Jehovah, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month. [verse 39] And Aaron was a hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor. [verse 4] while the Egyptians were burying all their first-born, whom Jehovah had smitten among them: upon their gods also Jehovah executed judgments. [verse 40] And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

[verse 6] And they journeyed from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness. [verse 7] And they journeyed from Etham, and turned back unto Pi-hahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon: and they encamped before Migdol.

[verse 9] And they journeyed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve springs of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees; and they encamped there."
330,Numbers 33:50-56,"[Numbers] [ch 33] [verse 50] And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, [verse 51] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, [verse 52] then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured [stones], and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places: [verse 53] and ye shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for unto you have I given the land to possess it. [verse 54] And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance: wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit. [verse 55] But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that ye let remain of them be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. [verse 56] And it shall come to pass, that, as I thought to do unto them, so will I do unto you."
331,Numbers 34:1-29,"[Numbers] [ch 34] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 10] And ye shall mark out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham; [verse 11] and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward; [verse 12] and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about. [verse 13] And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which Jehovah hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe; [verse 14] for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance: [verse 15] the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising. [verse 16] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, [verse 17] These are the names of the men that shall divide the land unto you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. [verse 18] And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance. [verse 19] And these are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. [verse 2] Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof), [verse 20] And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud. [verse 21] Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. [verse 22] And of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Bukki the son of Jogli. [verse 23] Of the children of Joseph: of the tribe of the children of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod. [verse 24] And of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan. [verse 25] And of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the son of Parnach. [verse 26] And of the tribe of the children of Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son of Azzan. [verse 27] And of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince, Ahihud the son of Shelomi. [verse 28] And of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince, Pedahel the son of Ammihud. [verse 29] These are they whom Jehovah commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan. [verse 3] then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward; [verse 4] and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out thereof shall be southward of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall go forth to Hazar-addar, and pass along to Azmon; [verse 5] and the border shall turn about from Azmon unto the brook of Egypt, and the goings out thereof shall be at the sea. [verse 6] And for the western border, ye shall have the great sea and the border [thereof] : this shall be your west border. [verse 7] And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall mark out for you mount Hor; [verse 8] from mount Hor ye shall mark out unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad; [verse 9] and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out thereof shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be your north border."
332,Numbers 35:1-8,"[Numbers] [ch 35] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, [verse 2] Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and suburbs for the cities round about them shall ye give unto the Levites. [verse 3] And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs shall be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for all their beasts. [verse 4] And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about. [verse 5] And ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities. [verse 6] And the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee unto: and besides them ye shall give forty and two cities. [verse 7] All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities; them [shall ye give] with their suburbs. [verse 8] And concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall take many; and from the few ye shall take few: every one according to his inheritance which he inheriteth shall give of his cities unto the Levites."
333,Numbers 35:9-34,"[Numbers] [ch 35] [verse 10] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, [verse 11] then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither. [verse 12] And the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation for judgment. [verse 13] And the cities which ye shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge. [verse 14] Ye shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge. [verse 15] For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that every one that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither. [verse 16] But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. [verse 17] And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. [verse 18] Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. [verse 19] The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death. [verse 20] And if he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died, [verse 21] or in enmity smote him with his hand, so that he died; he that smote him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meeteth him. [verse 22] But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him anything without lying in wait, [verse 23] or with any stone, whereby a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm; [verse 24] then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances; [verse 25] and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil. [verse 26] But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth, [verse 27] and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood, [verse 28] because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession. [verse 29] And these things shall be for a statute [and] ordinance unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. [verse 30] Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die. [verse 31] Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death. [verse 32] And ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest. [verse 33] So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood, it polluteth the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it. [verse 34] And thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, Jehovah, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel. [verse 9] And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
334,Numbers 36:1-13,"[Numbers] [ch 36] [verse 1] And the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the children of Israel: [verse 10] Even as Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad: [verse 11] for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons. [verse 12] They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. [verse 13] These are the commandments and the ordinances which Jehovah commanded by Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. [verse 2] and they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters. [verse 3] And if they be married to any of the sons of the [other] tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance. [verse 4] And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers. [verse 5] And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right. [verse 6] This is the thing which Jehovah doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married. [verse 7] So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. [verse 8] And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. [verse 9] So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave every one to his own inheritance."
335,Deuteronomy 1:6-8,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 1] [verse 6] Jehovah our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain: [verse 7] turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and unto all [the places] nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. [verse 8] Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them."
336,Deuteronomy 1:8,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 1] [verse 8] Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them."
337,Deuteronomy 1:9-18,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 1] [verse 10] Jehovah your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude. [verse 11] Jehovah, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you! [verse 12] How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? [verse 13] Take you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you. [verse 14] And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good [for us] to do. [verse 15] So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes. [verse 16] And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner that is with him. [verse 17] Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it. [verse 18] And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do. [verse 9] And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:"
338,Deuteronomy 1:19-25,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 1] [verse 19] And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea. [verse 20] And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the hill-country of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God giveth unto us. [verse 21] Behold, Jehovah thy God hath set the land before thee: go up, take possession, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed. [verse 22] And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come. [verse 23] And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe: [verse 24] and they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. [verse 25] And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which Jehovah our God giveth unto us."
339,Deuteronomy 1:29-33,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 1] [verse 29] Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. [verse 30] Jehovah your God who goeth before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, [verse 31] and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that Jehovah thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place. [verse 32] Yet in this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God, [verse 33] who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day."
340,Deuteronomy 1:34-45,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 1] [verse 34] And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying, [verse 35] Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers, [verse 36] save Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed Jehovah. [verse 37] Also Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither: [verse 38] Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage thou him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. [verse 39] Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. [verse 40] But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea. [verse 41] Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight, according to all that Jehovah our God commanded us. And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country. [verse 42] And Jehovah said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies. [verse 43] So I spake unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country. [verse 44] And the Amorites, that dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah. [verse 45] And ye returned and wept before Jehovah; but Jehovah hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you."
341,Deuteronomy 2:5,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 2] [verse 5] contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession."
342,Deuteronomy 2:9-19,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 2] [verse 10] (The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim: [verse 11] these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. [verse 12] The Horites also dwelt in Seir aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which Jehovah gave unto them.) [verse 13] Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered. [verse 14] And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah sware unto them. [verse 15] Moreover the hand of Jehovah was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed. [verse 16] So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, [verse 17] that Jehovah spake unto me, saying, [verse 18] Thou art this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab: [verse 19] and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, vex them not, nor contend with them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession. [verse 9] And Jehovah said unto me, Vex not Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession."
343,Deuteronomy 2:19-21,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 2] [verse 19] and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, vex them not, nor contend with them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession. [verse 20] (That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, [verse 21] a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Jehovah destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead;"
344,Deuteronomy 2:24-25,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 2] [verse 24] Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. [verse 25] This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee."
345,Deuteronomy 2:30-36,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 2] [verse 30] But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as at this day. [verse 31] And Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. [verse 32] Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Jahaz. [verse 33] And Jehovah our God delivered him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. [verse 34] And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining: [verse 35] only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken. [verse 36] From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and [from] the city that is in the valley, even unto Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; Jehovah our God delivered up all before us:"
346,Deuteronomy 2:30,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 2] [verse 30] But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as at this day."
347,Deuteronomy 3:1-11,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 3] [verse 1] Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei. [verse 10] all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. [verse 11] (For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.) [verse 2] And Jehovah said unto me, Fear him not; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon. [verse 3] So Jehovah our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. [verse 4] And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. [verse 5] All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many. [verse 6] And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. [verse 7] But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey unto ourselves. [verse 8] And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon unto mount Hermon; [verse 9] ([ which] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir;)"
348,Deuteronomy 3:21-22,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 3] [verse 21] And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall Jehovah do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over. [verse 22] Ye shall not fear them; for Jehovah your God, he it is that fighteth for you."
349,Deuteronomy 3:23-27,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 3] [verse 23] And I besought Jehovah at that time, saying, [verse 24] O Lord Jehovah, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy mighty acts? [verse 25] Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. [verse 26] But Jehovah was wroth with me for your sakes, and hearkened not unto me; and Jehovah said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter. [verse 27] Get thee up unto the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan."
350,Deuteronomy 4:3,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 4] [verse 3] Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did because of Baal-peor; for all the men that followed Baal-peor, Jehovah thy God hath destroyed them from the midst of thee."
351,"Deuteronomy 4:12, 15, 33, 36","[Deuteronomy] [ch 4] [verse 12] And Jehovah spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of words, but ye saw no form; only [ye heard] a voice. [verse 15] Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of form on the day that Jehovah spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire. [verse 33] Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? [verse 36] Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he made thee to see his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire."
352,Deuteronomy 4:25-28,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 4] [verse 25] When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah thy God, to provoke him to anger; [verse 26] I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over the Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed. [verse 27] And Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and ye shall be left few in number among the nations, whither Jehovah shall lead you away. [verse 28] And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell."
353,Deuteronomy 4:29-31,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 4] [verse 29] But from thence ye shall seek Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt find him, when thou searchest after him with all thy heart and with all thy soul. [verse 30] When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, in the latter days thou shalt return to Jehovah thy God, and hearken unto his voice: [verse 31] for Jehovah thy God is a merciful God; he will not fail thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them."
354,Deuteronomy 4:37,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 4] [verse 37] And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;"

[verse 11] Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain: for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. [verse 12] Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee. [verse 13] Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; [verse 14] but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou. [verse 15] And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God brought thee out thence by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm: therefore Jehovah thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day. [verse 16] Honor thy father and thy mother, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee; that thy days may be long, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee. [verse 17] Thou shalt not kill. [verse 18] Neither shalt thou commit adultery. [verse 19] Neither shalt thou steal. [verse 20] Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor. [verse 21] Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor's wife; neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor's house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, his ox, or his ass, or anything that is thy neighbor's. [verse 4] Jehovah spake with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire, [verse 5] (I stood between Jehovah and you at that time, to show you the word of Jehovah: for ye were afraid because of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying, [verse 6] I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. [verse 7] Thou shalt have no other gods before me. [verse 8] Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, [nor] any likeness [of anything] that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: [verse 9] thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I, Jehovah, thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me;"
356,"Deuteronomy 5:4, 22, 24, 26","[Deuteronomy] [ch 5] [verse 22] These words Jehovah spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them unto me. [verse 24] and ye said, Behold, Jehovah our God hath showed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth speak with man, and he liveth. [verse 26] For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? [verse 4] Jehovah spake with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,"

358,Deuteronomy 6:4-9,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 6] [verse 4] Hear, O Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah: [verse 5] and thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. [verse 6] And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart; [verse 7] and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. [verse 8] And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. [verse 9] And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates."
359,Deuteronomy 6:10-15,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 6] [verse 10] And it shall be, when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee, great and goodly cities, which thou buildest not, [verse 11] and houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and cisterns hewn out, which thou hewedst not, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou plantedst not, and thou shalt eat and be full; [verse 12] then beware lest thou forget Jehovah, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. [verse 13] Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; and him shalt thou serve, and shalt swear by his name. [verse 14] Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples that are round about you; [verse 15] for Jehovah thy God in the midst of thee is a jealous God; lest the anger of Jehovah thy God be kindled against thee, and he destroy thee from off the face of the earth."
360,Deuteronomy 6:16-21,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 6] [verse 16] Ye shall not tempt Jehovah your God, as ye tempted him in Massah. [verse 17] Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of Jehovah your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee. [verse 18] And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of Jehovah; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers, [verse 19] to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee, as Jehovah hath spoken. [verse 20] When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah our God hath commanded you?

[verse 4] For he will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and he will destroy thee quickly. [verse 5] But thus shall ye deal with them: ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire."
362,Deuteronomy 7:6-8,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 7] [verse 6] For thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God: Jehovah thy God hath chosen thee to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth. [verse 7] Jehovah did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all peoples: [verse 8] but because Jehovah loveth you, and because he would keep the oath which he sware unto your fathers, hath Jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt."

[verse 14] Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. [verse 15] And Jehovah will take away from thee all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, will he put upon thee, but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.

[verse 3] And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by everything that proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehovah doth man live.

367,Deuteronomy 8:11-20,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 8] [verse 11] Beware lest thou forget Jehovah thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command thee this day: [verse 12] lest, when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; [verse 13] and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied; [verse 14] then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget Jehovah thy God, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; [verse 15] who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, [wherein were] fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; [verse 16] who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not; that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end: [verse 17] and [lest] thou say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth. [verse 18] But thou shalt remember Jehovah thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as at this day. [verse 19] And it shall be, if thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. [verse 20] As the nations that Jehovah maketh to perish before you, so shall ye perish; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah your God."
368,Deuteronomy 9:3-5,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 9] [verse 3] Know therefore this day, that Jehovah thy God is he who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before thee: so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Jehovah hath spoken unto thee. [verse 4] Speak not thou in thy heart, after that Jehovah thy God hath thrust them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness Jehovah hath brought me in to possess this land; whereas for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah doth drive them out from before thee. [verse 5] Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart, dost thou go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may establish the word which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
369,Deuteronomy 9:7-21,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 9] [verse 10] And Jehovah delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them [was written] according to all the words, which Jehovah spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. [verse 11] And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Jehovah gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. [verse 12] And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image. [verse 13] Furthermore Jehovah spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: [verse 14] let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they. [verse 15] So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. [verse 16] And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against Jehovah your God; ye had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which Jehovah had commanded you. [verse 17] And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes. [verse 18] And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger. [verse 19] For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith Jehovah was wroth against you to destroy you. But Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also. [verse 20] And Jehovah was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. [verse 21] And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount. [verse 7] Remember, forget thou not, how thou provokedst Jehovah thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou wentest forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah. [verse 8] Also in Horeb ye provoked Jehovah to wrath, and Jehovah was angry with you to destroy you. [verse 9] When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which Jehovah made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water."
370,Deuteronomy 10:1-5,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 10] [verse 1] At that time Jehovah said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood. [verse 2] And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. [verse 3] So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand. [verse 4] And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Jehovah spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and Jehovah gave them unto me. [verse 5] And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Jehovah commanded me."
371,Deuteronomy 10:8,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 10] [verse 8] At that time Jehovah set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day."
372,Deuteronomy 10:12-13,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 10] [verse 12] And now, Israel, what doth Jehovah thy God require of thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, [verse 13] to keep the commandments of Jehovah, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?"

375,Deuteronomy 11:22-25,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 11] [verse 22] For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him; [verse 23] then will Jehovah drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves. [verse 24] Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the hinder sea shall be your border.

[verse 2] and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; [verse 3] thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams: for Jehovah your God proveth you, to know whether ye love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul. [verse 4] Ye shall walk after Jehovah your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him. [verse 5] And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he hath spoken rebellion against Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, to draw thee aside out of the way which Jehovah thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. [verse 6] If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, that is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; [verse 7] of the gods of the peoples that are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; [verse 8] thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: [verse 9] but thou shalt surely kill him; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people."

[verse 2] And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release that which he hath lent unto his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother; because Jehovah's release hath been proclaimed. [verse 3] Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it: but whatsoever of thine is with thy brother thy hand shall release. [verse 4] Howbeit there shall be no poor with thee; (for Jehovah will surely bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it;) [verse 5] if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all this commandment which I command thee this day.

[verse 4] And this is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee thither and live: whoso killeth his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past; [verse 5] as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbor, so that he dieth; he shall flee unto one of these cities and live: [verse 6] lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past. [verse 7] Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt set apart three cities for thee. [verse 8] And if Jehovah thy God enlarge thy border, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers; [verse 9] if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love Jehovah thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, besides these three:"
394,Deuteronomy 19:15-21,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 19] [verse 15] One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established. [verse 16] If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrong-doing, [verse 17] then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days; [verse 18] and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and have testified falsely against his brother; [verse 19] then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to do unto his brother: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. [verse 20] And those that remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee. [verse 21] And thine eyes shall not pity; life [shall go] for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."
395,Deuteronomy 20:1-20,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 20] [verse 1] When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, [and] a people more than thou, thou shalt not be afraid of them; for Jehovah thy God is with thee, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. [verse 10] When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it. [verse 11] And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that are found therein shall become tributary unto thee, and shall serve thee. [verse 12] And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it: [verse 13] and when Jehovah thy God delivereth it into thy hand, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: [verse 14] but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take for a prey unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which Jehovah thy God hath given thee. [verse 15] Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations. [verse 16] But of the cities of these peoples, that Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth; [verse 17] but thou shalt utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee; [verse 18] that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so would ye sin against Jehovah your God. [verse 19] When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by wielding an axe against them; for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged of thee? [verse 2] And it shall be, when ye draw nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people, [verse 20] Only the trees of which thou knowest that they are not trees for food, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it fall. [verse 3] and shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye draw nigh this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your heart faint; fear not, nor tremble, neither be ye affrighted at them; [verse 4] for Jehovah your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you. [verse 5] And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. [verse 6] And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not used the fruit thereof? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use the fruit thereof. [verse 7] And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her. [verse 8] And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart melt as his heart. [verse 9] And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall appoint captains of hosts at the head of the people."
396,Deuteronomy 20:4,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 20] [verse 4] for Jehovah your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you."
397,Deuteronomy 21:1-25:19,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 21] [verse 1] If one be found slain in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him; [verse 10] When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and Jehovah thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive, [verse 11] and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife; [verse 12] then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; [verse 13] and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. [verse 14] And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her. [verse 15] If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated; [verse 16] then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born: [verse 17] but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the first-born is his. [verse 18] If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them; [verse 19] then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; [verse 2] then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain: [verse 20] and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. [verse 21] And all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. [verse 22] And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree; [verse 23] his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is accursed of God; that thou defile not thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. [verse 3] and it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke; [verse 4] and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley. [verse 5] And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Jehovah thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be. [verse 6] And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley; [verse 7] and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it. [verse 8] Forgive, O Jehovah, thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood [to remain] in the midst of thy people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them. [verse 9] So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah. [ch 22] [verse 1] Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely bring them again unto thy brother. [verse 10] Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together. [verse 11] Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together. [verse 12] Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four borders of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself. [verse 13] If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her, [verse 14] and lay shameful things to her charge, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came nigh to her, I found not in her the tokens of virginity; [verse 15] then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate; [verse 16] and the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her; [verse 17] and, lo, he hath laid shameful things [to her charge], saying, I found not in thy daughter the tokens of virginity; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city. [verse 18] And the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him; [verse 19] and they shall fine him a hundred [shekels] of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days. [verse 2] And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it home to thy house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him. [verse 20] But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel; [verse 21] then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the harlot in her father's house: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. [verse 22] If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away the evil from Israel. [verse 23] If there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto a husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; [verse 24] then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them to death with stones; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbor's wife: so thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee. [verse 25] But if the man find the damsel that is betrothed in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her shall die: [verse 26] but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbor, and slayeth him, even so is this matter; [verse 27] for he found her in the field, the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her. [verse 28] If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, that is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; [verse 29] then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty [shekels] of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he hath humbled her; he may not put her away all his days. [verse 3] And so shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his garment; and so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found: thou mayest not hide thyself. [verse 30] A man shall not take his father's wife, and shall not uncover his father's skirt. [verse 4] Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again. [verse 5] A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment; for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah thy God. [verse 6] If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young: [verse 7] thou shalt surely let the dam go, but the young thou mayest take unto thyself; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days. [verse 8] When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thy house, if any man fall from thence. [verse 9] Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which thou hast sown, and the increase of the vineyard. [ch 23] [verse 1] He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah. [verse 10] If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of that which chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp: [verse 11] but it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun is down, he shall come within the camp. [verse 12] Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad: [verse 13] and thou shalt have a paddle among thy weapons; and it shall be, when thou sittest down abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee: [verse 14] for Jehovah thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy, that he may not see an unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee. [verse 15] Thou shalt not deliver unto his master a servant that is escaped from his master unto thee: [verse 16] he shall dwell with thee, in the midst of thee, in the place which he shall choose within one of thy gates, where it pleaseth him best: thou shalt not oppress him. [verse 17] There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel. [verse 18] Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, or the wages of a dog, into the house of Jehovah thy God for any vow: for even both these are an abomination unto Jehovah thy God. [verse 19] Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother; interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of anything that is lent upon interest: [verse 2] A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of Jehovah. [verse 20] unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon interest; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest, that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all that thou puttest thy hand unto, in the land whither thou goest in to possess it. [verse 21] When thou shalt vow a vow unto Jehovah thy God, thou shalt not be slack to pay it: for Jehovah thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee. [verse 22] But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. [verse 23] That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt observe and do; according as thou hast vowed unto Jehovah thy God, a freewill-offering, which thou hast promised with thy mouth. [verse 24] When thou comest into thy neighbor's vineyard, then thou mayest eat of grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel. [verse 25] When thou comest into thy neighbor's standing grain, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thy hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbor's standing grain. [verse 3] An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Jehovah for ever: [verse 4] because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee. [verse 5] Nevertheless Jehovah thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but Jehovah thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because Jehovah thy God loved thee. [verse 6] Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever. [verse 7] Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a sojourner in his land. [verse 8] The children of the third generation that are born unto them shall enter into the assembly of Jehovah. [verse 9] When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies, then thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing. [ch 24] [verse 1] When a man taketh a wife, and marrieth her, then it shall be, if she find no favor in his eyes, because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house. [verse 10] When thou dost lend thy neighbor any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge. [verse 11] Thou shalt stand without, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring forth the pledge without unto thee. [verse 12] And if he be a poor man, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge; [verse 13] thou shalt surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before Jehovah thy God. [verse 14] Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy sojourners that are in thy land within thy gates: [verse 15] in his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto Jehovah, and it be sin unto thee. [verse 16] The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin. [verse 17] Thou shalt not wrest the justice [due] to the sojourner, [or] to the fatherless, nor take the widow's raiment to pledge; [verse 18] but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and Jehovah thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing. [verse 19] When thou reapest thy harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands. [verse 2] And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's [wife] . [verse 20] When thou beatest thine olive-tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow. [verse 21] When thou gatherest [the grapes of] thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it after thee: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow. [verse 22] And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing. [verse 3] And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife; [verse 4] her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before Jehovah: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. [verse 5] When a man taketh a new wife, he shall not go out in the host, neither shall he be charged with any business: he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken. [verse 6] No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh [a man's] life to pledge. [verse 7] If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, or sell him; then that thief shall die: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. [verse 8] Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do. [verse 9] Remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Miriam, by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt. [ch 25] [verse 1] If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, and [the judges] judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked; [verse 10] And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed. [verse 11] When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets; [verse 12] then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall have no pity. [verse 13] Thou shalt not have in thy bag diverse weights, a great and a small. [verse 14] Thou shalt not have in thy house diverse measures, a great and a small. [verse 15] A perfect and just weight shalt thou have; a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee. [verse 16] For all that do such things, [even] all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto Jehovah thy God. [verse 17] Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt; [verse 18] how he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God. [verse 19] Therefore it shall be, when Jehovah thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget. [verse 2] and it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his wickedness, by number. [verse 3] Forty stripes he may give him, he shall not exceed; lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee. [verse 4] Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out [the grain] . [verse 5] If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no son, the wife of the dead shall not be married without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her. [verse 6] And it shall be, that the first-born that she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother that is dead, that his name be not blotted out of Israel. [verse 7] And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then his brother's wife shall go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband's brother unto me. [verse 8] Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand, and say, I like not to take her; [verse 9] then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face; and she shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto the man that doth not build up his brother's house."
398,Deuteronomy 26:1-11,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 26] [verse 1] And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein, [verse 10] And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which thou, O Jehovah, hast given me. And thou shalt set it down before Jehovah thy God, and worship before Jehovah thy God: [verse 11] and thou shalt rejoice in all the good which Jehovah thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thy house, thou, and the Levite, and the sojourner that is in the midst of thee. [verse 2] that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which thou shalt bring in from thy land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee; and thou shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there. [verse 3] And thou shalt come unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto Jehovah thy God, that I am come unto the land which Jehovah sware unto our fathers to give us. [verse 4] And the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand, and set it down before the altar of Jehovah thy God. [verse 5] And thou shalt answer and say before Jehovah thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father; and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and he became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous. [verse 6] And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage: [verse 7] and we cried unto Jehovah, the God of our fathers, and Jehovah heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression; [verse 8] and Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders; [verse 9] and he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey."
399,Deuteronomy 26:12-15,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 26] [verse 12] When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithe of thine increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then thou shalt give it unto the Levite, to the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled. [verse 13] And thou shalt say before Jehovah thy God, I have put away the hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandment which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed any of thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them: [verse 14] I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I put away thereof, being unclean, nor given thereof for the dead: I have hearkened to the voice of Jehovah my God; I have done according to all that thou hast commanded me. [verse 15] Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the ground which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey."
400,Deuteronomy 26:16-19,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 26] [verse 16] This day Jehovah thy God commandeth thee to do these statutes and ordinances: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul. [verse 17] Thou hast avouched Jehovah this day to be thy God, and that thou wouldest walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and hearken unto his voice: [verse 18] and Jehovah hath avouched thee this day to be a people for his own possession, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments; [verse 19] and to make thee high above all nations that he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayest be a holy people unto Jehovah thy God, as he hath spoken."
401,Deuteronomy 27:1-8,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 27] [verse 1] And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandment which I command you this day. [verse 2] And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over the Jordan unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaster them with plaster: [verse 3] and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over; that thou mayest go in unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath promised thee. [verse 4] And it shall be, when ye are passed over the Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster. [verse 5] And there shalt thou build an altar unto Jehovah thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt lift up no iron [tool] upon them. [verse 6] Thou shalt build the altar of Jehovah thy God of unhewn stones; and thou shalt offer burnt-offerings thereon unto Jehovah thy God: [verse 7] and thou shalt sacrifice peace-offerings, and shalt eat there; and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God. [verse 8] And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly."
402,Deuteronomy 27:15-26,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 27] [verse 15] Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image, an abomination unto Jehovah, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and setteth it up in secret. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen. [verse 16] Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen. [verse 17] Cursed be he that removeth his neighbor's landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen. [verse 18] Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen. [verse 19] Cursed be he that wresteth the justice [due] to the sojourner, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen. [verse 20] Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife, because he hath uncovered his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen. [verse 21] Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen. [verse 22] Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen. [verse 23] Cursed be he that lieth with his mother-in-law. And all the people shall say, Amen. [verse 24] Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbor in secret. And all the people shall say, Amen. [verse 25] Cursed be he that taketh a bribe to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen. [verse 26] Cursed be he that confirmeth not the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen."
403,Deuteronomy 28:1-14,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 28] [verse 1] And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that Jehovah thy God will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth: [verse 10] And all the peoples of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of Jehovah; and they shall be afraid of thee. [verse 11] And Jehovah will make thee plenteous for good, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers to give thee. [verse 12] Jehovah will open unto thee his good treasure the heavens, to give the rain of thy land in its season, and to bless all the work of thy hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow. [verse 13] And Jehovah will make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if thou shalt hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do [them] , [verse 14] and shalt not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them. [verse 2] and all these blessings shall come upon thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God. [verse 3] Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field. [verse 4] Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy beasts, the increase of thy cattle, and the young of thy flock. [verse 5] Blessed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough. [verse 6] Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out. [verse 7] Jehovah will cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thee: they shall come out against thee one way, and shall flee before thee seven ways. [verse 8] Jehovah will command the blessing upon thee in thy barns, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto; and he will bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee. [verse 9] Jehovah will establish thee for a holy people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee; if thou shalt keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God, and walk in his ways."
404,Deuteronomy 28:15-68,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 28] [verse 15] But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day, that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee. [verse 16] Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field. [verse 17] Cursed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough. [verse 18] Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, the increase of thy cattle, and the young of thy flock. [verse 19] Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out. [verse 20] Jehovah will send upon thee cursing, discomfiture, and rebuke, in all that thou puttest thy hand unto to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the evil of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me. [verse 21] Jehovah will make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest in to possess it. [verse 22] Jehovah will smite thee with consumption, and with fever, and with inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish. [verse 23] And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron. [verse 24] Jehovah will make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed. [verse 25] Jehovah will cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies; thou shalt go out one way against them, and shalt flee seven ways before them: and thou shalt be tossed to and from among all the kingdoms of the earth. [verse 26] And thy dead body shall be food unto all birds of the heavens, and unto the beasts of the earth; and there shall be none to frighten them away. [verse 27] Jehovah will smite thee with the boil of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scurvy, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed. [verse 28] Jehovah will smite thee with madness, and with blindness, and with astonishment of heart; [verse 29] and thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and robbed alway, and there shall be none to save thee. [verse 30] Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build a house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not use the fruit thereof. [verse 31] Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to save thee. [verse 32] Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people; and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day: and there shall be nought in the power of thy hand. [verse 33] The fruit of thy ground, and all thy labors, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway; [verse 34] so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. [verse 35] Jehovah will smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore boil, whereof thou canst not be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the crown of thy head. [verse 36] Jehovah will bring thee, and thy king whom thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation that thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone. [verse 37] And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples whither Jehovah shall lead thee away. [verse 38] Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather little in; for the locust shall consume it. [verse 39] Thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them, but thou shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather [the grapes] ; for the worm shall eat them. [verse 40] Thou shalt have olive-trees throughout all thy borders, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast [its fruit] . [verse 41] Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be thine; for they shall go into captivity. [verse 42] All thy trees and the fruit of thy ground shall the locust possess. [verse 43] The sojourner that is in the midst of thee shall mount up above thee higher and higher; and thou shalt come down lower and lower. [verse 44] He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail. [verse 45] And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee: [verse 46] and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever. [verse 47] Because thou servedst not Jehovah thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things; [verse 48] therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies that Jehovah shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee. [verse 49] Jehovah will bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand; [verse 50] a nation of fierce countenance, that shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young, [verse 51] and shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy ground, until thou be destroyed; that also shall not leave thee grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of thy cattle, or the young of thy flock, until they have caused thee to perish. [verse 52] And they shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fortified walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land; and they shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which Jehovah thy God hath given thee. [verse 53] And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, whom Jehovah thy God hath given thee, in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee. [verse 54] The man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children whom he hath remaining; [verse 55] so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he hath nothing left him, in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in all thy gates. [verse 56] The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, [verse 57] and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children whom she shall bear; for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates. [verse 58] If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, JEHOVAH THY GOD; [verse 59] then Jehovah will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance. [verse 60] And he will bring upon thee again all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. [verse 61] Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will Jehovah bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed. [verse 62] And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God. [verse 63] And it shall come to pass, that, as Jehovah rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Jehovah will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest in to possess it. [verse 64] And Jehovah will scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers, even wood and stone. [verse 65] And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of thy foot: but Jehovah will give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of soul; [verse 66] and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear night and day, and shalt have no assurance of thy life. [verse 67] In the morning thou shalt say, Would it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would it were morning! for the fear of thy heart which thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. [verse 68] And Jehovah will bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I said unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall sell yourselves unto your enemies for bondmen and for bondwomen, and no man shall buy you."
405,Deuteronomy 29:5,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 29] [verse 5] And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxed old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxed old upon thy foot."
406,Deuteronomy 29:10-29,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 29] [verse 10] Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel, [verse 11] your little ones, your wives, and thy sojourner that is in the midst of thy camps, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water; [verse 12] that thou mayest enter into the covenant of Jehovah thy God, and into his oath, which Jehovah thy God maketh with thee this day; [verse 13] that he may establish thee this day unto himself for a people, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he spake unto thee, and as he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. [verse 14] Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath, [verse 15] but with him that standeth here with us this day before Jehovah our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day [verse 16] (for ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which ye passed; [verse 17] and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them); [verse 18] lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth [ gall and wormwood; [verse 19] and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry. [verse 20] Jehovah will not pardon him, but then the anger of Jehovah and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie upon him, and Jehovah will blot out his name from under heaven. [verse 21] And Jehovah will set him apart unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law. [verse 22] And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses wherewith Jehovah hath made it sick; [verse 23] [ and that] the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, [and] a burning, [that] it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: [verse 24] even all the nations shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger? [verse 25] Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, [verse 26] and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods that they knew not, and that he had not given unto them: [verse 27] therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book; [verse 28] and Jehovah rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day. [verse 29] The secret things belong unto Jehovah our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law."
407,Deuteronomy 30:1-10,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 30] [verse 1] And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither Jehovah thy God hath driven thee, [verse 10] if thou shalt obey the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou turn unto Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul. [verse 2] and shalt return unto Jehovah thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul; [verse 3] that then Jehovah thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples, whither Jehovah thy God hath scattered thee. [verse 4] If [any of] thine outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven, from thence will Jehovah thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee: [verse 5] and Jehovah thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers. [verse 6] And Jehovah thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live. [verse 7] And Jehovah thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee. [verse 8] And thou shalt return and obey the voice of Jehovah, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day. [verse 9] And Jehovah thy God will make thee plenteous in all the work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, for good: for Jehovah will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers;"
408,Deuteronomy 30:11-20,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 30] [verse 11] For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off. [verse 12] It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it? [verse 13] Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it? [verse 14] But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it. [verse 15] See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; [verse 16] in that I command thee this day to love Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that thou mayest live and multiply, and that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in the land whither thou goest in to possess it. [verse 17] But if thy heart turn away, and thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; [verse 18] I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your days in the land, whither thou passest over the Jordan to go in to possess it. [verse 19] I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed; [verse 20] to love Jehovah thy God, to obey his voice, and to cleave unto him; for he is thy life, and the length of thy days; that thou mayest dwell in the land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them."
409,"Deuteronomy 31:2, 14","[Deuteronomy] [ch 31] [verse 14] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting. [verse 2] And he said unto them, I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan."
410,Deuteronomy 31:15,[Deuteronomy] [ch 31] [verse 15] And Jehovah appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.
411,Deuteronomy 31:16-18,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 31] [verse 16] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and play the harlot after the strange gods of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them. [verse 17] Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us? [verse 18] And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods."
412,Deuteronomy 31:19-22,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 31] [verse 19] Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel. [verse 20] For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxed fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant. [verse 21] And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I sware. [verse 22] So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel."
413,Deuteronomy 31:23,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 31] [verse 23] And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee."
414,Deuteronomy 32:1-43,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 32] [verse 1] Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; And let the earth hear the words of my mouth. [verse 10] He found him in a desert land, And in the waste howling wilderness; He compassed him about, he cared for him, He kept him as the apple of his eye. [verse 11] As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, That fluttereth over her young, He spread abroad his wings, he took them, He bare them on his pinions. [verse 12] Jehovah alone did lead him, And there was no foreign god with him. [verse 13] He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he did eat the increase of the field; And he made him to suck honey out of the rock, And oil out of the flinty rock; [verse 14] Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs, And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the finest of the wheat; And of the blood of the grape thou drankest wine. [verse 15] But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: Thou art waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art become sleek; Then he forsook God who made him, And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. [verse 16] They moved him to jealousy with strange [gods] ; With abominations provoked they him to anger. [verse 17] They sacrificed unto demons, [which were] no God, To gods that they knew not, To new [gods] that came up of late, Which your fathers dreaded not. [verse 18] Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, And hast forgotten God that gave thee birth. [verse 19] And Jehovah saw [it], and abhorred [them], Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters. [verse 2] My doctrine shall drop as the rain; My speech shall distil as the dew, As the small rain upon the tender grass, And as the showers upon the herb. [verse 20] And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: For they are a very perverse generation, Children in whom is no faithfulness. [verse 21] They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; They have provoked me to anger with their vanities: And I will move them to jealousy with those that are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. [verse 22] For a fire is kindled in mine anger, And burneth unto the lowest Sheol, And devoureth the earth with its increase, And setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains. [verse 23] I will heap evils upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them: [verse 24] [ They shall be] wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust. [ [verse 25] Without shall the sword bereave, And in the chambers terror; [It shall destroy] both young man and virgin, The suckling with the man of gray hairs. [verse 26] I said, I would scatter them afar, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men; [verse 27] Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, Lest their adversaries should judge amiss, Lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, And Jehovah hath not done all this. [verse 28] For they are a nation void of counsel, And there is no understanding in them. [verse 29] Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would consider their latter end! [verse 3] For I will proclaim the name of Jehovah: Ascribe ye greatness unto our God. [verse 30] How should one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Except their Rock had sold them, And Jehovah had delivered them up? [verse 31] For their rock is not as our Rock, Even our enemies themselves being judges. [verse 32] For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, And of the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter: [verse 33] Their wine is the poison of serpents, And the cruel venom of asps. [verse 34] Is not this laid up in store with me, Sealed up among my treasures? [verse 35] Vengeance is mine, and recompense, At the time when their foot shall slide: For the day of their calamity is at hand, And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste. [verse 36] For Jehovah will judge his people, And repent himself for his servants; When he seeth that [their] power is gone, And there is none [remaining], shut up or left at large. [verse 37] And he will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which they took refuge; [verse 38] Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, [And] drank the wine of their drink-offering? Let them rise up and help you, Let them be your protection. [verse 39] See now that I, even I, am he, And there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; And there is none that can deliver out of my hand. [verse 4] The Rock, his work is perfect; For all his ways are justice: A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, Just and right is he. [verse 40] For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live for ever, [verse 41] If I whet my glittering sword, And my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine adversaries, And will recompense them that hate me. [verse 42] I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, And my sword shall devour flesh; With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the head of the leaders of the enemy. [verse 43] Rejoice, O ye nations, [with] his people: For he will avenge the blood of his servants, And will render vengeance to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land, for his people. [verse 5] They have dealt corruptly with him, [they are] not his children, [it is] their blemish; [They are] a perverse and crooked generation. [verse 6] Do ye thus requite Jehovah, O foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? He hath made thee, and established thee. [verse 7] Remember the days of old, Consider the years of many generations: Ask thy father, and he will show thee; Thine elders, and they will tell thee. [verse 8] When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, When he separated the children of men, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel. [verse 9] For Jehovah's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance."
415,Deuteronomy 32:48-52,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 32] [verse 48] And Jehovah spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, [verse 49] Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession; [verse 50] and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people: [verse 51] because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel. [verse 52] For thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel."
416,Deuteronomy 33:1-29,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 33] [verse 1] And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. [verse 10] They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, And Israel thy law: They shall put incense before thee, And whole burnt-offering upon thine altar. [verse 11] Bless, Jehovah, his substance, And accept the work of his hands: Smite through the loins of them that rise up against him, And of them that hate him, that they rise not again. [verse 12] Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell in safety by him; He covereth him all the day long, And he dwelleth between his shoulders. [verse 13] And of Joseph he said, Blessed of Jehovah be his land, For the precious things of heaven, for the dew, And for the deep that coucheth beneath, [verse 14] And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, And for the precious things of the growth of the moons, [verse 15] And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, And for the precious things of the everlasting hills, [verse 16] And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof, And the good will of him that dwelt in the bush. Let [the blessing] come upon the head of Joseph, And upon the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. [verse 17] The firstling of his herd, majesty is his; And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox: With them he shall push the peoples all of them, [even] the ends of the earth: And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, And they are the thousands of Manasseh. [verse 18] And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; And, Issachar, in thy tents. [verse 19] They shall call the peoples unto the mountain; There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness: For they shall suck the abundance of the seas, And the hidden treasures of the sand. [verse 2] And he said, Jehovah came from Sinai, And rose from Seir unto them; He shined forth from mount Paran, And he came from the ten thousands of holy ones: At his right hand was a fiery law for them. [verse 20] And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: He dwelleth as a lioness, And teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head. [verse 21] And he provided the first part for himself, For there was the lawgiver's portion reserved; And he came [with] the heads of the people; He executed the righteousness of Jehovah, And his ordinances with Israel. [verse 22] And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp, That leapeth forth from Bashan. [verse 23] And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, And full with the blessing of Jehovah, Possess thou the west and the south. [verse 24] And of Asher he said, Blessed be Asher with children; Let him be acceptable unto his brethren, And let him dip his foot in oil. [verse 25] Thy bars shall be iron and brass; And as thy days, so shall thy strength be. [verse 26] There is none like unto God, O Jeshurun, Who rideth upon the heavens for thy help, And in his excellency on the skies. [verse 27] The eternal God is [thy] dwelling-place, And underneath are the everlasting arms. And he thrust out the enemy from before thee, And said, Destroy. [verse 28] And Israel dwelleth in safety, The fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of grain and new wine; Yea, his heavens drop down dew. [verse 29] Happy art thou, O Israel: Who is like unto thee, a people saved by Jehovah, The shield of thy help, And the sword of thy excellency! And thine enemies shall submit themselves unto thee; And thou shalt tread upon their high places. [verse 3] Yea, he loveth the people; All his saints are in thy hand: And they sat down at thy feet; [Every one] shall receive of thy words. [verse 4] Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob. [verse 5] And he was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered, All the tribes of Israel together. [verse 6] Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few. [verse 7] And this is [the blessing] of Judah: and he said, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah, And bring him in unto his people. With his hands he contended for himself; And thou shalt be a help against his adversaries. [verse 8] And of Levi he said, Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with thy godly one, Whom thou didst prove at Massah, With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; [verse 9] Who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him; Neither did he acknowledge his brethren, Nor knew he his own children: For they have observed thy word, And keep thy covenant."
417,Deuteronomy 34:1-4,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 34] [verse 1] And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, [verse 2] and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the hinder sea, [verse 3] and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm-trees, unto Zoar. [verse 4] And Jehovah said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither."
418,Deuteronomy 34:5-6,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 34] [verse 5] So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Jehovah. [verse 6] And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day."
419,Deuteronomy 34:7,"[Deuteronomy] [ch 34] [verse 7] And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated."
420,Joshua 1:1-9,"[Joshua] [ch 1] [verse 1] Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying, [verse 2] Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. [verse 3] Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, to you have I given it, as I spake unto Moses. [verse 4] From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border. [verse 5] There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. [verse 6] Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I sware unto their fathers to give them. [verse 7] Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest. [verse 8] This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate thereon day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. [verse 9] Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage; be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for Jehovah thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest."
421,"Joshua 1:5, 9","[Joshua] [ch 1] [verse 5] There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

423,Joshua 1:7-8,"[Joshua] [ch 1] [verse 7] Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest. [verse 8] This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate thereon day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success."
424,Joshua 2:1-7,"[Joshua] [ch 2] [verse 1] And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go, view the land, and Jericho. And they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there. [verse 2] And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel to search out the land. [verse 3] And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, that are entered into thy house; for they are come to search out all the land. [verse 4] And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said, Yea, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they were: [verse 5] and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; whither the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for ye will overtake them. [verse 6] But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof. [verse 7] And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they that pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate."
425,Joshua 2:8-21,"[Joshua] [ch 2] [verse 10] For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. [verse 11] And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for Jehovah your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath. [verse 12] Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a true token; [verse 13] and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death. [verse 14] And the men said unto her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business; and it shall be, when Jehovah giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee. [verse 15] Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. [verse 16] And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way. [verse 17] And the men said unto her, We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. [verse 18] Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household. [verse 19] And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him. [verse 20] But if thou utter this our business, then we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. [verse 21] And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window. [verse 8] And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof; [verse 9] and she said unto the men, I know that Jehovah hath given you the land, and that the fear of you is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you."
426,Joshua 2:15-24,"[Joshua] [ch 2] [verse 15] Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.

[verse 20] But if thou utter this our business, then we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. [verse 21] And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window. [verse 22] And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not. [verse 23] Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them. [verse 24] And they said unto Joshua, Truly Jehovah hath delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land do melt away before us."
427,Joshua 3:1-4,"[Joshua] [ch 3] [verse 1] And Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over. [verse 2] And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp; [verse 3] and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it. [verse 4] Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore."
428,Joshua 3:7,"[Joshua] [ch 3] [verse 7] And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee."
429,Joshua 3:8,"[Joshua] [ch 3] [verse 8] And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan."
430,Joshua 3:15-17,"[Joshua] [ch 3] [verse 15] and when they that bare the ark were come unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (for the Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest,) [verse 16] that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho. [verse 17] And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation were passed clean over the Jordan."
431,Joshua 3:17,"[Joshua] [ch 3] [verse 17] And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation were passed clean over the Jordan."
432,Joshua 4:1-9,"[Joshua] [ch 4] [verse 1] And it came to pass, when all the nation were clean passed over the Jordan, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying, [verse 2] Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man, [verse 3] and command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place, where ye shall lodge this night. [verse 4] Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man: [verse 5] and Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; [verse 6] that this may be a sign among you, that, when your children ask in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones? [verse 7] then ye shall say unto them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever. [verse 8] And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there. [verse 9] And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests that bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day."
433,Joshua 4:18,"[Joshua] [ch 4] [verse 18] And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah were come up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their place, and went over all its banks, as aforetime."

435,Joshua 5:2-3,"[Joshua] [ch 5] [verse 2] At that time Jehovah said unto Joshua, Make thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time. [verse 3] And Joshua made him knives of flint, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins."
436,Joshua 5:9,"[Joshua] [ch 5] [verse 9] And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, unto this day."
437,Joshua 5:12,"[Joshua] [ch 5] [verse 12] And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year."
438,Joshua 5:13-15,"[Joshua] [ch 5] [verse 13] And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? [verse 14] And he said, Nay; but [as] prince of the host of Jehovah am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant? [verse 15] And the prince of Jehovah's host said unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so."
439,Joshua 5:14-15,"[Joshua] [ch 5] [verse 14] And he said, Nay; but [as] prince of the host of Jehovah am I now come.

[verse 15] And the prince of Jehovah's host said unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so."
440,Joshua 6:2-5,"[Joshua] [ch 6] [verse 2] And Jehovah said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor. [verse 3] And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. [verse 4] And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. [verse 5] And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him."
441,Joshua 6:20,"[Joshua] [ch 6] [verse 20] So the people shouted, and [the priests] blew the trumpets; and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city."
442,"Joshua 6:17, 23, 25","[Joshua] [ch 6] [verse 17] And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to Jehovah: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. [verse 23] And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them without the camp of Israel. [verse 25] But Rahab the harlot, and her father's household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel unto this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."
443,Joshua 6:26,"[Joshua] [ch 6] [verse 26] And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: with the loss of his first-born shall he lay the foundation thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it."
444,Joshua 7:1,"[Joshua] [ch 7] [verse 1] But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the children of Israel."
445,Joshua 7:4-5,"[Joshua] [ch 7] [verse 4] So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai. [verse 5] And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them [from] before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water."
446,Joshua 7:6-9,"[Joshua] [ch 7] [verse 6] And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads. [verse 7] And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan! [verse 8] Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies! [verse 9] For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do for thy great name?"
447,Joshua 7:10-15,"[Joshua] [ch 7] [verse 10] And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face? [verse 11] Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and they have even put it among their own stuff. [verse 12] Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the devoted thing from among you. [verse 13] Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow: for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, There is a devoted thing in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the devoted thing from among you. [verse 14] In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which Jehovah taketh shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah shall take shall come near by households; and the household which Jehovah shall take shall come near man by man. [verse 15] And it shall be, that he that is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath; because he hath transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel."
448,Joshua 7:16-18,"[Joshua] [ch 7] [verse 16] So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: [verse 17] and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken: [verse 18] and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken."
449,Joshua 7:19-21,"[Joshua] [ch 7] [verse 19] And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me. [verse 20] And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: [verse 21] when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it."
450,Joshua 7:24-26,"[Joshua] [ch 7] [verse 24] And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them up unto the valley of Achor. [verse 25] And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones. [verse 26] And they raised over him a great heap of stones, unto this day; and Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day."
451,Joshua 8:1,"[Joshua] [ch 8] [verse 1] And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land;"
452,Joshua 8:1-2,"[Joshua] [ch 8] [verse 1] And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land; [verse 2] And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: set thee an ambush for the city behind it."
453,"Joshua 8:7, 18","[Joshua] [ch 8] [verse 18] And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city. [verse 7] and ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city: for Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand."
454,"Joshua 8:18, 26","[Joshua] [ch 8] [verse 18] And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city. [verse 26] For Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai."
455,Joshua 8:24-29,"[Joshua] [ch 8] [verse 24] And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. [verse 25] And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai. [verse 26] For Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. [verse 27] Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey unto themselves, according unto the word of Jehovah which he commanded Joshua. [verse 28] So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day. [verse 29] And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto this day."
456,Joshua 8:30-32,"[Joshua] [ch 8] [verse 30] Then Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal, [verse 31] as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, and sacrificed peace-offerings. [verse 32] And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel."
457,Joshua 9:3-15,"[Joshua] [ch 9] [verse 10] and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth. [verse 11] And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: and now make ye a covenant with us. [verse 12] This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy: [verse 13] and these wine-skins, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey. [verse 14] And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of Jehovah. [verse 15] And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them. [verse 3] But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai, [verse 4] they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-skins, old and rent and bound up, [verse 5] and old and patched shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become mouldy. [verse 6] And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country: now therefore make ye a covenant with us. [verse 7] And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with you? [verse 8] And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye? [verse 9] And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,"
458,Joshua 9:14-15,"[Joshua] [ch 9] [verse 14] And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of Jehovah. [verse 15] And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them."
459,Joshua 10:12-14,"[Joshua] [ch 10] [verse 12] Then spake Joshua to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; And thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon. [verse 13] And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, Until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. [verse 14] And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel."
460,Joshua 10:14,"[Joshua] [ch 10] [verse 14] And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel."
461,Joshua 10:11,"[Joshua] [ch 10] [verse 11] And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword."
462,Joshua 10:11,"[Joshua] [ch 10] [verse 11] And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword."
463,Joshua 10:16-17,"[Joshua] [ch 10] [verse 16] And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. [verse 17] And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah."
464,Joshua 10:18,"[Joshua] [ch 10] [verse 18] And Joshua said, Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:"
465,"Joshua 10:19, 24-25","[Joshua] [ch 10] [verse 19] but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for Jehovah your God hath delivered them into your hand. [verse 24] And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them. [verse 25] And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus shall Jehovah do to all your enemies against whom ye fight."
466,Joshua 10:28-43,"[Joshua] [ch 10] [verse 28] And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof: he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho. [verse 29] And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah: [verse 30] and Jehovah delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining in it; and he did unto the king thereof as he had done unto the king of Jericho. [verse 31] And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: [verse 32] and Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel; and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah. [verse 33] Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining. [verse 34] And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it; [verse 35] and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish. [verse 36] And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it: [verse 37] and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were therein. [verse 38] And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it: [verse 39] and he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king thereof. [verse 40] So Joshua smote all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded. [verse 41] And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon. [verse 42] And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because Jehovah, the God of Israel, fought for Israel. [verse 43] And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal."
467,Joshua 11:1-5,"[Joshua] [ch 11] [verse 1] And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard thereof, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, [verse 2] and to the kings that were on the north, in the hill-country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west, [verse 3] to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah. [verse 4] And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many. [verse 5] And all these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel."
468,Joshua 11:6,"[Joshua] [ch 11] [verse 6] And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them; for to-morrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hock their horses, and burn their chariots with fire."
469,Joshua 11:6,"[Joshua] [ch 11] [verse 6] And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them; for to-morrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hock their horses, and burn their chariots with fire."
470,Joshua 11:7-8,"[Joshua] [ch 11] [verse 7] So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them. [verse 8] And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Sidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining."
471,Joshua 11:9-13,"[Joshua] [ch 11] [verse 10] And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms. [verse 11] And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was none left that breathed: and he burnt Hazor with fire. [verse 12] And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded. [verse 13] But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn. [verse 9] And Joshua did unto them as Jehovah bade him: he hocked their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire."
472,Joshua 11:20,"[Joshua] [ch 11] [verse 20] For it was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses."
473,Joshua 11:23,"[Joshua] [ch 11] [verse 23] So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Jehovah spake unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land had rest from war."
474,Joshua 13:1-7,"[Joshua] [ch 13] [verse 1] Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Jehovah said unto him, Thou art old and well stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed. [verse 2] This is the land that yet remaineth: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites; [verse 3] from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the border of Ekron northward, [which] is reckoned to the Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim, [verse 4] on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongeth to the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the border of the Amorites; [verse 5] and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entrance of Hamath; [verse 6] all the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only allot thou it unto Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee. [verse 7] Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half-tribe of Manasseh."
475,Joshua 13:1,"[Joshua] [ch 13] [verse 1] Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Jehovah said unto him, Thou art old and well stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed."
476,Joshua 14:6-15,"[Joshua] [ch 14] [verse 10] And now, behold, Jehovah hath kept me alive, as he spake, these forty and five years, from the time that Jehovah spake this word unto Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old. [verse 11] As yet I am as strong this day as I as in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in. [verse 12] Now therefore give me this hill-country, whereof Jehovah spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified: it may be that Jehovah will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Jehovah spake. [verse 13] And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance. [verse 14] Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite unto this day; because that he wholly followed Jehovah, the God of Israel. [verse 15] Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba; [which Arba was] the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war. [verse 6] Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that Jehovah spake unto Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea. [verse 7] Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart. [verse 8] Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Jehovah my God. [verse 9] And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast wholly followed Jehovah my God."
477,Joshua 14:10-11,"[Joshua] [ch 14] [verse 10] And now, behold, Jehovah hath kept me alive, as he spake, these forty and five years, from the time that Jehovah spake this word unto Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old. [verse 11] As yet I am as strong this day as I as in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in."
478,Joshua 14:15,[Joshua] [ch 14] [verse 15] Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba; [which Arba was] the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.
479,Joshua 20:1-9,"[Joshua] [ch 20] [verse 1] And Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying, [verse 2] Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Assign you the cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by Moses, [verse 3] that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly [and] unawares may flee thither: and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood. [verse 4] And he shall flee unto one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them. [verse 5] And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbor unawares, and hated him not beforetime. [verse 6] And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the manslayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled. [verse 7] And they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill-country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron) in the hill-country of Judah. [verse 8] And beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. [verse 9] These were the appointed cities for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person unwittingly might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation."
480,Joshua 21:1-45,"[Joshua] [ch 21] [verse 1] Then came near the heads of fathers' [houses] of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of fathers' [houses] of the tribes of the children of Israel; [verse 10] and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi; for theirs was the first lot. [verse 11] And they gave them Kiriath-arba, [which Arba was] the father of Anak (the same is Hebron), in the hill-country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it. [verse 12] But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession. [verse 13] And unto the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Libnah with its suburbs, [verse 14] and Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs, [verse 15] and Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs, [verse 16] and Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs, [and] Beth-shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes. [verse 17] And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs, [verse 18] Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities. [verse 19] All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs. [verse 2] and they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle. [verse 20] And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites, even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim. [verse 21] And they gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the hill-country of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer with its suburbs, [verse 22] and Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth-horon with its suburbs; four cities. [verse 23] And out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs, [verse 24] Aijalon with its suburbs, Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; four cities. [verse 25] And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; two cities. [verse 26] All the cities of the families of the rest of the children of Kohath were ten with their suburbs. [verse 27] And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe of Manasseh [they gave] Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Be-eshterah with its suburbs; two cities. [verse 28] And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its suburbs, Daberath with its suburbs, [verse 29] Jarmuth with its suburbs, En-gannim with its suburbs; four cities. [verse 3] And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of Jehovah, these cities with their suburbs. [verse 30] And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs, [verse 31] Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities. [verse 32] And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammoth-dor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities. [verse 33] All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

[verse 36] And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahaz with its suburbs, [verse 37] Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs; four cities. [verse 38] And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with its suburbs, [verse 39] Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs; four cities in all. [verse 4] And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities. [verse 40] All [these were] the cities of the children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities. [verse 41] All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs. [verse 42] These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus it was with all these cities. [verse 43] So Jehovah gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein. [verse 44] And Jehovah gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; Jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand. [verse 45] There failed not aught of any good thing which Jehovah had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass. [verse 5] And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities. [verse 6] And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities. [verse 7] The children of Merari according to their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities. [verse 8] And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as Jehovah commanded by Moses. [verse 9] And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are [here] mentioned by name:"
481,Joshua 21:43,"[Joshua] [ch 21] [verse 43] So Jehovah gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein."
482,Joshua 21:44,"[Joshua] [ch 21] [verse 44] And Jehovah gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; Jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand."
483,Joshua 21:45,[Joshua] [ch 21] [verse 45] There failed not aught of any good thing which Jehovah had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.
484,Joshua 22:10-11,"[Joshua] [ch 22] [verse 10] And when they came unto the region about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look upon. [verse 11] And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertaineth to the children of Israel."
485,Joshua 22:12-20,"[Joshua] [ch 22] [verse 12] And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war. [verse 13] And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, [verse 14] and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers' house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were every one of them head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of Israel. [verse 15] And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying, [verse 16] Thus saith the whole congregation of Jehovah, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that ye have builded you an altar, to rebel this day against Jehovah? [verse 17] Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves unto this day, although there came a plague upon the congregation of Jehovah, [verse 18] that ye must turn away this day from following Jehovah? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to-day against Jehovah, that to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel. [verse 19] Howbeit, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of Jehovah, wherein Jehovah's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against Jehovah, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God. [verse 20] Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity."
486,Joshua 22:21-29,"[Joshua] [ch 22] [verse 21] Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spake unto the heads of the thousands of Israel, [verse 22] The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, the Mighty One, God, Jehovah, he knoweth; and Israel he shall know: if it be in rebellion, or if in trespass against Jehovah (save thou us not this day,) [verse 23] that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Jehovah; or if to offer thereon burnt-offering or meal-offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings thereon, let Jehovah himself require it; [verse 24] and if we have not [rather] out of carefulness done this, [and] of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with Jehovah, the God of Israel? [verse 25] for Jehovah hath made the Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no portion in Jehovah: so might your children make our children cease from fearing Jehovah. [verse 26] Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice: [verse 27] but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of Jehovah before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no portion in Jehovah. [verse 28] Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Behold the pattern of the altar of Jehovah, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you. [verse 29] Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah, and turn away this day from following Jehovah, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for meal-offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle."
487,Joshua 22:30-34,"[Joshua] [ch 22] [verse 30] And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them well. [verse 31] And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we know that Jehovah is in the midst of us, because ye have not committed this trespass against Jehovah: now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah. [verse 32] And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.

[verse 4] And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands [lay] cut off upon the threshold; only [the stump of] Dagon was left to him."
631,1 Samuel 5:6-7,"[1 Samuel] [ch 5] [verse 6] But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders thereof.

[verse 11] They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that is slay us not, and our people.

[verse 8] According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.

[verse 13] And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. [verse 14] And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. [verse 15] And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. [verse 16] And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.

[verse 3] Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine: [verse 4] and they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread, which thou shalt receive of their hand. [verse 5] After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying: [verse 6] and the Spirit of Jehovah will come mightily upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. [verse 7] And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion shall serve thee; for God is with thee. [verse 8] And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come unto thee, and show thee what thou shalt do.

656,1 Samuel 13:13-14,"[1 Samuel] [ch 13] [verse 13] And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would Jehovah have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. [verse 14] But now thy kingdom shall not continue: Jehovah hath sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah hath appointed him to be prince over his people, because thou hast not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee."
657,1 Samuel 14:41-42,"[1 Samuel] [ch 14] [verse 41] Therefore Saul said unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, Show the right. And Jonathan and Saul were taken [by lot] ; but the people escaped. [verse 42] And Saul said, Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken."
658,1 Samuel 15:2-3,"[1 Samuel] [ch 15] [verse 2] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt.

[verse 19] Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of Jehovah, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah?"
661,1 Samuel 15:22-23,"[1 Samuel] [ch 15] [verse 22] And Samuel said, Hath Jehovah as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. [verse 23] For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, he hath also rejected thee from being king."
662,1 Samuel 15:28-29,"[1 Samuel] [ch 15] [verse 28] And Samuel said unto him, Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou.

663,1 Samuel 15:35,[1 Samuel] [ch 15] [verse 35] And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
664,1 Samuel 16:1-3,"[1 Samuel] [ch 16] [verse 1] And Jehovah said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go: I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons. [verse 2] And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah. [verse 3] And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee."
665,1 Samuel 16:6-10,"[1 Samuel] [ch 16] [verse 10] And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Jehovah hath not chosen these. [verse 6] And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovah's anointed is before him. [verse 7] But Jehovah said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for [Jehovah seeth] not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looketh on the heart. [verse 8] Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this. [verse 9] Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this."
666,1 Samuel 16:11-12,"[1 Samuel] [ch 16] [verse 11] And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither. [verse 12] And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he."
667,1 Samuel 16:13,"[1 Samuel] [ch 16] [verse 13] Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah."

669,1 Samuel 16:23,"[1 Samuel] [ch 16] [verse 23] And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."
670,1 Samuel 17:45-51,"[1 Samuel] [ch 17] [verse 45] Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. [verse 46] This day will Jehovah deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day unto the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, [verse 47] and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is Jehovah's, and he will give you into our hand. [verse 48] And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. [verse 49] And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth. [verse 50] So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. [verse 51] Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled."
671,"1 Samuel 18:12, 14, 28","[1 Samuel] [ch 18] [verse 12] And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him, and was departed from Saul.

[verse 21] And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied. [verse 22] Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah. [verse 23] And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.

[verse 3] And David's men said unto him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines? [verse 4] Then David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand."
679,1 Samuel 23:10-12,"[1 Samuel] [ch 23] [verse 10] Then said David, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thy servant hath surely heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. [verse 11] Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Jehovah, the God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant.

680,1 Samuel 23:14,"[1 Samuel] [ch 23] [verse 14] And David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand."
681,1 Samuel 23:25-28,"[1 Samuel] [ch 23] [verse 25] And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard [that], he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon. [verse 26] And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them. [verse 27] But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land. [verse 28] So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth."
682,1 Samuel 24:1-7,"[1 Samuel] [ch 24] [verse 1] And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi. [verse 2] Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. [verse 3] And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave. [verse 4] And the men of David said unto him, Behold, the day of which Jehovah said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily. [verse 5] And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt. [verse 6] And he said unto his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing unto my lord, Jehovah's anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Jehovah's anointed. [verse 7] So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way."

And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. [verse 17] And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rendered unto me good, whereas I have rendered unto thee evil. [verse 18] And thou hast declared this day how that thou hast dealt well with me, forasmuch as when Jehovah had delivered me up into thy hand, thou killedst me not. [verse 19] For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore Jehovah reward thee good for that which thou hast done unto me this day. [verse 20] And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand."
684,1 Samuel 25:38,"[1 Samuel] [ch 25] [verse 38] And it came to pass about ten days after, that Jehovah smote Nabal, so that he died."
685,1 Samuel 25:39-42,"[1 Samuel] [ch 25] [verse 39] And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Jehovah, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back his servant from evil: and the evil-doing of Nabal hath Jehovah returned upon his own head. And David sent and spake concerning Abigail, to take her to him to wife. [verse 40] And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife. [verse 41] And she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord. [verse 42] And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife."
686,1 Samuel 26:7-12,"[1 Samuel] [ch 26] [verse 10] And David said, As Jehovah liveth, Jehovah will smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish. [verse 11] Jehovah forbid that I should put forth my hand against Jehovah's anointed: but now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go. [verse 12] So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's head; and they gat them away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Jehovah was fallen upon them. [verse 7] So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him. [verse 8] Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time. [verse 9] And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can put forth his hand against Jehovah's anointed, and be guiltless?"

[verse 13] And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what seest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth. [verse 14] And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance. [verse 15] And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do. [verse 16] And Samuel said, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing Jehovah is departed from thee, and is become thine adversary? [verse 17] And Jehovah hath done unto thee, as he spake by me: and Jehovah hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David. [verse 18] Because thou obeyedst not the voice of Jehovah, and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath Jehovah done this thing unto thee this day. [verse 19] Moreover Jehovah will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: Jehovah will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines."

[verse 18] And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives. [verse 19] And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: David brought back all.

[verse 4] Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it. [verse 5] And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him. [verse 6] So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armorbearer, and all his men, that same day together. [verse 7] And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them."

Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. [verse 11] Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, [said the king], he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons. [verse 12] And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth. [verse 13] So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he did eat continually at the king's table. And he was lame in both his feet. [verse 2] And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he. [verse 3] And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame of his feet. [verse 4] And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar. [verse 5] Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. [verse 6] And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold, thy servant! [verse 7] And David said unto him, Fear not; for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. [verse 8] And he did obeisance, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am? [verse 9] Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master's son."
732,2 Samuel 10:9-19,"[2 Samuel] [ch 10] [verse 10] And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon. [verse 11] And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee. [verse 12] Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good. [verse 13] So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him. [verse 14] And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem. [verse 15] And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together. [verse 16] And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head. [verse 17] And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him. [verse 18] And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians [the men of] seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, so that he died there. [verse 19] And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more. [verse 9] Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:"
733,2 Samuel 11:2-4,"[2 Samuel] [ch 11] [verse 2] And it came to pass at eventide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon. [verse 3] And David send and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite? [verse 4] And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned unto her house."
734,2 Samuel 11:5,"[2 Samuel] [ch 11] [verse 5] And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child."
735,2 Samuel 11:14-17,"[2 Samuel] [ch 11] [verse 14] And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. [verse 15] And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die. [verse 16] And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men were. [verse 17] And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also."
736,2 Samuel 11:27,"[2 Samuel] [ch 11] [verse 27] And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Jehovah."
737,2 Samuel 12:1,"[2 Samuel] [ch 12] [verse 1] And Jehovah sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor."
738,2 Samuel 12:1-4,"[2 Samuel] [ch 12] [verse 1] And Jehovah sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor. [verse 2] The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds; [verse 3] but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. [verse 4] And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him."
739,2 Samuel 12:7-12,"[2 Samuel] [ch 12] [verse 10] Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. [verse 11] Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. [verse 12] For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun. [verse 7] And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; [verse 8] and I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added unto thee such and such things. [verse 9] Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do that which is evil in his sight? thou hast smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon."
740,2 Samuel 12:10-12,"[2 Samuel] [ch 12] [verse 10] Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. [verse 11] Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. [verse 12] For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun."
741,2 Samuel 12:13,"[2 Samuel] [ch 12] [verse 13] And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said unto David, Jehovah also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die."
742,2 Samuel 12:13-14,"[2 Samuel] [ch 12] [verse 13] And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said unto David, Jehovah also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. [verse 14] Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die."
743,2 Samuel 12:15,"[2 Samuel] [ch 12] [verse 15] And Nathan departed unto his house. And Jehovah struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick."
744,2 Samuel 12:16-17,"[2 Samuel] [ch 12] [verse 16] David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth. [verse 17] And the elders of his house arose, [and stood] beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them."
745,2 Samuel 12:18,"[2 Samuel] [ch 12] [verse 18] And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!"
746,2 Samuel 12:20,"[2 Samuel] [ch 12] [verse 20] Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of Jehovah, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat."
747,2 Samuel 12:24,"[2 Samuel] [ch 12] [verse 24] And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him;"
748,2 Samuel 12:24-25,"[2 Samuel] [ch 12] [verse 24] And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him; [verse 25] and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah's sake."
749,2 Samuel 12:26-31,"[2 Samuel] [ch 12] [verse 26] Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. [verse 27] And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yea, I have taken the city of waters. [verse 28] Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name. [verse 29] And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it. [verse 30] And he took the crown of their king from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and [in it were] precious stones; and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much. [verse 31] And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem."
750,2 Samuel 13:1-14,"[2 Samuel] [ch 13] [verse 1] And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. [verse 10] And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. [verse 11] And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister. [verse 12] And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly. [verse 13] And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee. [verse 14] Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her. [verse 2] And Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything unto her. [verse 3] But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man. [verse 4] And he said unto him, Why, O son of the king, art thou thus lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister. [verse 5] And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand. [verse 6] So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, Let her sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand. [verse 7] Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him food. [verse 8] So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. [verse 9] And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him."
751,2 Samuel 13:28-29,"[2 Samuel] [ch 13] [verse 28] And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant. [verse 29] And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled."
752,2 Samuel 14:1-20,"[2 Samuel] [ch 14] [verse 1] Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom. [verse 10] And the king said, Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more. [verse 11] Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth. [verse 12] Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on. [verse 13] And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one. [verse 14] For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God take away life, but deviseth means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him. [verse 15] Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant. [verse 16] For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God. [verse 17] Then thy handmaid said, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and Jehovah thy God be with thee. [verse 18] Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak. [verse 19] And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid; [verse 2] And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead: [verse 20] to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth. [verse 3] and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth. [verse 4] And when the woman of Tekoa spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king. [verse 5] And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead. [verse 6] And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him. [verse 7] And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they say, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth. [verse 8] And the king said unto the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee. [verse 9] And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and the king and his throne be guiltless."
753,2 Samuel 14:21-24,"[2 Samuel] [ch 14] [verse 21] And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back. [verse 22] And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favor in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of his servant. [verse 23] So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. [verse 24] And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king's face."
754,2 Samuel 15:10-12,"[2 Samuel] [ch 15] [verse 10] But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron. [verse 11] And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not anything. [verse 12] And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom."
755,2 Samuel 15:13-17,"[2 Samuel] [ch 15] [verse 13] And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. [verse 14] And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. [verse 15] And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose. [verse 16] And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house. [verse 17] And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak."
756,2 Samuel 15:18-22,"[2 Samuel] [ch 15] [verse 18] And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king. [verse 19] Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king: for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile; [return] to thine own place. [verse 20] Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth be with thee. [verse 21] And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Jehovah liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be. [verse 22] And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him."
757,2 Samuel 15:30,"[2 Samuel] [ch 15] [verse 30] And David went up by the ascent of the [mount of] Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up."
758,2 Samuel 15:31,"[2 Samuel] [ch 15] [verse 31] And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness."
759,2 Samuel 15:32-37,"[2 Samuel] [ch 15] [verse 32] And it came to pass, that, when David was come to the top [of the ascent], where God was worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head. [verse 33] And David said unto him, If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto me: [verse 34] but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel. [verse 35] And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. [verse 36] Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye shall hear. [verse 37] So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem."
760,2 Samuel 16:5-8,"[2 Samuel] [ch 16] [verse 5] And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came. [verse 6] And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. [verse 7] And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow: [verse 8] Jehovah hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art [taken] in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood."
761,2 Samuel 16:10-12,"[2 Samuel] [ch 16] [verse 10] And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because Jehovah hath said unto him, Curse David; who then shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so? [verse 11] And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more [may] this Benjamite now [do it] ? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah hath bidden him. [verse 12] It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done unto me, and that Jehovah will requite me good for [his] cursing of me this day."
762,2 Samuel 17:14,"[2 Samuel] [ch 17] [verse 14] And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Jehovah had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom."
763,2 Samuel 17:14,"[2 Samuel] [ch 17] [verse 14] And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Jehovah had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom."
764,2 Samuel 17:23,"[2 Samuel] [ch 17] [verse 23] And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father."
765,2 Samuel 17:22-29,"[2 Samuel] [ch 17] [verse 22] Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan. [verse 23] And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father. [verse 24] Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. [verse 25] And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother. [verse 26] And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead. [verse 27] And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, [verse 28] brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched [grain], and beans, and lentils, and parched [pulse] , [verse 29] and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness."
766,2 Samuel 18:6-8,"[2 Samuel] [ch 18] [verse 6] So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim. [verse 7] And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men. [verse 8] For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured."
767,2 Samuel 18:8,[2 Samuel] [ch 18] [verse 8] For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
768,2 Samuel 18:9,"[2 Samuel] [ch 18] [verse 9] And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between heaven and earth; and the mule that was under him went on."
769,2 Samuel 18:14-15,"[2 Samuel] [ch 18] [verse 14] Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak. [verse 15] And ten young men that bare Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him."
770,2 Samuel 18:33-19:4,"[2 Samuel] [ch 18] [verse 33] And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son! [ch 19] [verse 1] And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom. [verse 2] And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people; for the people heard say that day, The king grieveth for his son. [verse 3] And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. [verse 4] And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
771,2 Samuel 19:9-15,"[2 Samuel] [ch 19] [verse 10] And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back? [verse 11] And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, [to bring him] to his house. [verse 12] Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king? [verse 13] And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab. [verse 14] And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as [the heart of] one man; so that they sent unto the king, [saying], Return thou, and all thy servants. [verse 15] So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan. [verse 9] And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom."
772,2 Samuel 20:1-2,"[2 Samuel] [ch 20] [verse 1] And there happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel. [verse 2] So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem."
773,2 Samuel 20:4-22,"[2 Samuel] [ch 20] [verse 10] But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri. [verse 11] And there stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow Joab. [verse 12] And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still. [verse 13] When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. [verse 14] And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him. [verse 15] And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down. [verse 16] Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee. [verse 17] And he came near unto her; and the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I do hear. [verse 18] Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask [counsel] at Abel: and so they ended [the matter] . [verse 19] I am of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah? [verse 20] And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. [verse 21] The matter is not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall. [verse 22] Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king. [verse 4] Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be thou here present. [verse 5] So Amasa went to call [the men of] Judah together; but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him. [verse 6] And David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight. [verse 7] And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. [verse 8] When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out. [verse 9] And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with thee, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him."
774,2 Samuel 21:1,"[2 Samuel] [ch 21] [verse 1] And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Jehovah. And Jehovah said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites."
775,2 Samuel 21:1,"[2 Samuel] [ch 21] [verse 1] And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Jehovah. And Jehovah said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites."

777,2 Samuel 21:6-9,"[2 Samuel] [ch 21] [verse 6] let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Jehovah. And the king said, I will give them. [verse 7] But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Jehovah's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul. [verse 8] But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bare to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite: [verse 9] And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Jehovah, and they fell [all] seven together. And they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest."
778,2 Samuel 21:14,"[2 Samuel] [ch 21] [verse 14] And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land."
779,2 Samuel 21:15-22,"[2 Samuel] [ch 21] [verse 15] And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. And David waxed faint; [verse 16] and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred [shekels] of brass in weight, he being girded with a new [sword], thought to have slain David. [verse 17] But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the lamp of Israel. [verse 18] And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant. [verse 19] And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. [verse 20] And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant. [ [verse 21] And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, slew him.

782,2 Samuel 22:1-51,"[2 Samuel] [ch 22] [verse 1] And David spake unto Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: [verse 10] He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet. [verse 11] And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind. [verse 12] And he made darkness pavilions round about him, Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies. [verse 13] At the brightness before him Coals of fire were kindled. [verse 14] Jehovah thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered his voice. [verse 15] And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; Lightning, and discomfited them. [verse 16] Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, By the rebuke of Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils. [verse 17] He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters; [verse 18] He delivered me from my strong enemy, From them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me. [verse 19] They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay. [verse 2] and he said, Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine; [verse 20] He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me. [verse 21] Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. [verse 22] For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God. [verse 23] For all his ordinances were before me; And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them. [verse 24] I was also perfect toward him; And I kept myself from mine iniquity. [verse 25] Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight. [verse 26] With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect; [verse 27] With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward. [verse 28] And the afflicted people thou wilt save; But thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down. [verse 29] For thou art my lamp, O Jehovah; And Jehovah will lighten my darkness. [verse 3] God, my rock, in him will I take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; My saviour, thou savest me from violence. [verse 30] For by thee I run upon a troop; By my God do I leap over a wall. [verse 31] As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him. [verse 32] For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, save our God? [verse 33] God is my strong fortress; And he guideth the perfect in his way. [verse 34] He maketh his feet like hinds' [feet], And setteth me upon my high places. [verse 35] He teacheth my hands to war, So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass. [verse 36] Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; And thy gentleness hath made me great. [verse 37] Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; And my feet have not slipped. [verse 38] I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; Neither did I turn again till they were consumed. [verse 39] And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, so that they cannot arise: Yea, they are fallen under my feet. [verse 4] I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies. [verse 40] For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. [verse 41] Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, That I might cut off them that hate me. [verse 42] They looked, but there was none to save; Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not. [verse 43] Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I did crush them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad. [verse 44] Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people; Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me. [verse 45] The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me: As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me. [verse 46] The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places. [verse 47] Jehovah liveth; And blessed be my rock; And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation, [verse 48] Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And that bringeth down peoples under me, [verse 49] And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man. [verse 5] For the waves of death compassed me; The floods of ungodliness made me afraid: [verse 50] Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name. [verse 51] Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore. [verse 6] The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me. [verse 7] In my distress I called upon Jehovah; Yea, I called unto my God: And he heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry [came] into his ears. [verse 8] Then the earth shook and trembled, The foundations of heaven quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth. [verse 9] There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it."
783,2 Samuel 22:2-3,"[2 Samuel] [ch 22] [verse 2] and he said, Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine; [verse 3] God, my rock, in him will I take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; My saviour, thou savest me from violence."

785,2 Samuel 23:1-7,"[2 Samuel] [ch 23] [verse 1] Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse saith, And the man who was raised on high saith, The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet psalmist of Israel: [verse 2] The Spirit of Jehovah spake by me, And his word was upon my tongue. [verse 3] The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spake to me: One that ruleth over men righteously, That ruleth in the fear of God, [verse 4] [ He shall be] as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, A morning without clouds, [When] the tender grass [springeth] out of the earth, Through clear shining after rain. [verse 5] Verily my house is not so with God; Yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, Ordered in all things, and sure: For it is all my salvation, and all [my] desire, Although he maketh it not to grow. [verse 6] But the ungodly shall be all of them as thorns to be thrust away, Because they cannot be taken with the hand; [verse 7] But the man that toucheth them Must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear: And they shall be utterly burned with fire in [their] place."

[verse 3] And Joab said unto the king, Now Jehovah thy God add unto the people, how many soever they may be, a hundredfold; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing? [verse 4] Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel."
790,2 Samuel 24:10,"[2 Samuel] [ch 24] [verse 10] And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.

792,2 Samuel 24:11-13,"[2 Samuel] [ch 24] [verse 11] And when David rose up in the morning, the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying, [verse 12] Go and speak unto David, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee. [verse 13] So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? or shall there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise thee, and consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me."
793,2 Samuel 24:14,"[2 Samuel] [ch 24] [verse 14] And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of Jehovah; for his mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man."

803,1 Kings 2:13-25,"[1 Kings] [ch 2] [verse 13] Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably. [verse 14] He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on. [verse 15] And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's; for it was his from Jehovah. [verse 16] And now I ask one petition of thee; deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on. [verse 17] And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king (for he will not say thee nay), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. [verse 18] And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king. [verse 19] Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. [verse 20] Then she said, I ask one small petition of thee; deny me not. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny thee. [verse 21] And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife. [verse 22] And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. [verse 23] Then king Solomon sware by Jehovah, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life. [verse 24] Now therefore as Jehovah liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day. [verse 25] And king Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him, so that he died."
804,1 Kings 2:26-27,"[1 Kings] [ch 2] [verse 26] And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted. [verse 27] So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto Jehovah, that he might fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh."
805,1 Kings 2:27,"[1 Kings] [ch 2] [verse 27] So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto Jehovah, that he might fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh."
806,1 Kings 2:28-34,"[1 Kings] [ch 2] [verse 28] And the tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. [verse 29] And it was told king Solomon, Joab is fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him. [verse 30] And Benaiah came to the Tent of Jehovah, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me. [verse 31] And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house. [verse 32] And Jehovah will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew it not, [to wit], Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah. [verse 33] So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Jehovah. [verse 34] Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness."
807,1 Kings 3:5,"[1 Kings] [ch 3] [verse 5] In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give thee."
808,1 Kings 3:6-9,"[1 Kings] [ch 3] [verse 6] And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great lovingkindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great lovingkindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. [verse 7] And now, O Jehovah my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in. [verse 8] And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. [verse 9] Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this thy great people?"
809,1 Kings 3:10-14,"[1 Kings] [ch 3] [verse 10] And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. [verse 11] And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern justice; [verse 12] behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. [verse 13] And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee, all thy days. [verse 14] And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days."
810,1 Kings 3:14,"[1 Kings] [ch 3] [verse 14] And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days."
811,1 Kings 3:16-28,"[1 Kings] [ch 3] [verse 16] Then there came two women that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him. [verse 17] And the one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. [verse 18] And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. [verse 19] And this woman's child died in the night, because she lay upon it. [verse 20] And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. [verse 21] And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I did bear. [verse 22] And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king. [verse 23] Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living. [verse 24] And the king said, Fetch me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. [verse 25] And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. [verse 26] Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it. [verse 27] Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof. [verse 28] And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice."
812,1 Kings 3:28,"[1 Kings] [ch 3] [verse 28] And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice."
813,1 Kings 4:29-34,"[1 Kings] [ch 4] [verse 29] And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore. [verse 30] And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. [verse 31] For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations round about. [verse 32] And he spake three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five. [verse 33] And he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spake also of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fishes. [verse 34] And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom."
814,1 Kings 4:30-31,"[1 Kings] [ch 4] [verse 30] And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. [verse 31] For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations round about."
815,1 Kings 4:32,[1 Kings] [ch 4] [verse 32] And he spake three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five.

818,1 Kings 4:24,"[1 Kings] [ch 4] [verse 24] For he had dominion over all [the region] on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides round about him."
819,1 Kings 5:7,"[1 Kings] [ch 5] [verse 7] And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be Jehovah this day, who hath given unto David a wise son over this great people."
820,1 Kings 6:9-38,"[1 Kings] [ch 6] [verse 10] And he built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar. [verse 11] And the word of Jehovah came to Solomon, saying, [verse 12] Concerning this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute mine ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father. [verse 13] And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel. [verse 14] So Solomon built the house, and finished it. [verse 15] And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house unto the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir. [verse 16] And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the walls [of the ceiling] : he built [them] for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place. [verse 17] And the house, that is, the temple before [the oracle], was forty cubits [long] . [verse 18] And there was cedar on the house within, carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen. [verse 19] And he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah. [verse 20] And within the oracle was [a space of] twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar. [verse 21] So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold. [verse 22] And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold. [verse 23] And in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high. [verse 24] And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits. [verse 25] And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form. [verse 26] The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub. [verse 27] And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. [verse 28] And he overlaid the cherubim with gold. [verse 29] And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within and without. [verse 30] And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. [verse 31] And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood: the lintel [and] door-posts were a fifth part [of the wall] . [verse 32] So [he made] two doors of olive-wood; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees. [verse 33] So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, out of a fourth part [of the wall] ; [verse 34] and two doors of fir-wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. [verse 35] And he carved [thereon] cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work. [verse 36] And he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams. [verse 37] In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Jehovah laid, in the month Ziv. [verse 38] And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it. [verse 9] So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar."
821,1 Kings 6:11-13,"[1 Kings] [ch 6] [verse 11] And the word of Jehovah came to Solomon, saying, [verse 12] Concerning this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute mine ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father. [verse 13] And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel."

824,1 Kings 8:10-11,"[1 Kings] [ch 8] [verse 10] And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah, [verse 11] so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah."
825,1 Kings 8:10-11,"[1 Kings] [ch 8] [verse 10] And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah, [verse 11] so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah."
826,1 Kings 8:11,[1 Kings] [ch 8] [verse 11] so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.
827,1 Kings 8:22-53,"[1 Kings] [ch 8] [verse 22] And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven; [verse 23] and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart; [verse 24] who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day. [verse 25] Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me as thou hast walked before me. [verse 26] Now therefore, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father. [verse 27] But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded! [verse 28] Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee this day; [verse 29] that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof thou hast said, My name shall be there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place. [verse 30] And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place; and when thou hearest, forgive. [verse 31] If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come [and] swear before thine altar in this house; [verse 32] then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. [verse 33] When thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; if they turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house: [verse 34] then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers. [verse 35] When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them: [verse 36] then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. [verse 37] If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting [or] mildew, locust [or] caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be; [verse 38] what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, [or] by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house: [verse 39] then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;) [verse 40] that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. [verse 41] Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for thy name's sake [verse 42] (for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thine outstretched arm); when he shall come and pray toward this house; [verse 43] hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by my name. [verse 44] If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto Jehovah toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name; [verse 45] then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. [verse 46] If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy, far off or near; [verse 47] yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captive, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly; [verse 48] if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name: [verse 49] then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling-place, and maintain their cause; [verse 50] and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them [verse 51] (for they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron); [verse 52] that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them whensoever they cry unto thee. [verse 53] For thou didst separate them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord Jehovah."
828,"1 Kings 8:30, 32, 34, 36, 39, 43, 45, 49","[1 Kings] [ch 8] [verse 30] And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place; and when thou hearest, forgive. [verse 32] then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. [verse 34] then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers. [verse 36] then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. [verse 39] then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;) [verse 43] hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by my name. [verse 45] then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. [verse 49] then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling-place, and maintain their cause;"
829,1 Kings 8:54-64,"[1 Kings] [ch 8] [verse 54] And it was so, that, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto Jehovah, he arose from before the altar of Jehovah, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven. [verse 55] And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying, [verse 56] Blessed be Jehovah, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant. [verse 57] Jehovah our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us; [verse 58] that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers. [verse 59] And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before Jehovah, be nigh unto Jehovah our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require; [verse 60] that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah, he is God; there is none else. [verse 61] Let your heart therefore be perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day. [verse 62] And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Jehovah. [verse 63] And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered unto Jehovah, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah. [verse 64] The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings."
830,1 Kings 8:66,"[1 Kings] [ch 8] [verse 66] On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David his servant, and to Israel his people."
831,1 Kings 9:2,"[1 Kings] [ch 9] [verse 2] that Jehovah appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon."
832,1 Kings 9:3,"[1 Kings] [ch 9] [verse 3] And Jehovah said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually."
833,1 Kings 9:3,"[1 Kings] [ch 9] [verse 3] And Jehovah said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually."
834,1 Kings 9:4-5,"[1 Kings] [ch 9] [verse 4] And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances; [verse 5] then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever, according as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel."
835,1 Kings 9:6-9,"[1 Kings] [ch 9] [verse 6] But if ye shall turn away from following me, ye or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; [verse 7] then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples. [verse 8] And though this house is so high, yet shall every one that passeth by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house? [verse 9] and they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath Jehovah brought all this evil upon them."
836,1 Kings 10:1-3,"[1 Kings] [ch 10] [verse 1] And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Jehovah, she came to prove him with hard questions. [verse 2] And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. [verse 3] And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hid from the king which he told her not."
837,1 Kings 10:4-9,"[1 Kings] [ch 10] [verse 4] And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, [verse 5] and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her. [verse 6] And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom. [verse 7] Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard. [verse 8] Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, [and] that hear thy wisdom. [verse 9] Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because Jehovah loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do justice and righteousness."
838,1 Kings 10:9,"[1 Kings] [ch 10] [verse 9] Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because Jehovah loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do justice and righteousness."
839,1 Kings 10:14-29,"[1 Kings] [ch 10] [verse 14] Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, [verse 15] besides [that which] the traders [brought], and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mingled people, and of the governors of the country. [verse 16] And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred [shekels] of gold went to one buckler. [verse 17] And [he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. [verse 18] Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold. [verse 19] There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays. [verse 20] And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. [verse 21] And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. [verse 22] For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. [verse 23] So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. [verse 24] And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. [verse 25] And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. [verse 26] And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. [verse 27] And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance. [verse 28] And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price. [verse 29] And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out [ by their means."
840,1 Kings 11:1-8,"[1 Kings] [ch 11] [verse 1] Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites; [verse 2] of the nations concerning which Jehovah said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love. [verse 3] And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart. [verse 4] For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as was the heart of David his father. [verse 5] For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. [verse 6] And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and went not fully after Jehovah, as did David his father. [verse 7] Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon. [verse 8] And so did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods."
841,1 Kings 11:9,"[1 Kings] [ch 11] [verse 9] And Jehovah was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Jehovah, the God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice,"
842,1 Kings 11:9-13,"[1 Kings] [ch 11] [verse 10] and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which Jehovah commanded. [verse 11] Wherefore Jehovah said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. [verse 12] Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son. [verse 13] Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy son, for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen. [verse 9] And Jehovah was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Jehovah, the God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice,"
843,1 Kings 11:11-13,"[1 Kings] [ch 11] [verse 11] Wherefore Jehovah said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. [verse 12] Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son. [verse 13] Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy son, for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen."
844,"1 Kings 11:11, 31","[1 Kings] [ch 11] [verse 11] Wherefore Jehovah said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.

845,"1 Kings 11:14, 23","[1 Kings] [ch 11] [verse 14] And Jehovah raised up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom. [verse 23] And God raised up [another] adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah."
846,1 Kings 11:23-25,"[1 Kings] [ch 11] [verse 23] And God raised up [another] adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah. [verse 24] And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them [of Zobah] : and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.

855,1 Kings 12:6-15,"[1 Kings] [ch 12] [verse 10] And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou speak unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father's loins. [verse 11] And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. [verse 12] So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day. [verse 13] And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, [verse 14] and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. [verse 15] So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was a thing brought about of Jehovah, that he might establish his word, which Jehovah spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. [verse 6] And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people? [verse 7] And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever. [verse 8] But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him. [verse 9] And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?"

857,1 Kings 12:16-20,"[1 Kings] [ch 12] [verse 16] And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents. [verse 17] But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. [verse 18] Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. [verse 19] So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day. [verse 20] And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only."

861,1 Kings 12:26-30,"[1 Kings] [ch 12] [verse 26] And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now will the kingdom return to the house of David: [verse 27] if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah. [verse 28] Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. [verse 29] And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan. [verse 30] And this thing became a sin; for the people went [to worship] before the one, even unto Dan."

[verse 2] And he cried against the altar by the word of Jehovah, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith Jehovah: Behold, a son shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall they burn upon thee."
864,1 Kings 13:2,"[1 Kings] [ch 13] [verse 2] And he cried against the altar by the word of Jehovah, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith Jehovah: Behold, a son shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall they burn upon thee."

866,1 Kings 13:4,"[1 Kings] [ch 13] [verse 4] And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Beth-el, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him."
867,1 Kings 13:6,"[1 Kings] [ch 13] [verse 6] And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Jehovah thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God entreated Jehovah, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before."
868,1 Kings 13:8-9,"[1 Kings] [ch 13] [verse 8] And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place; [verse 9] for so was it charged me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that thou camest."
869,1 Kings 13:11-19,"[1 Kings] [ch 13] [verse 11] Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them also they told unto their father. [verse 12] And their father said unto them, What way went he? Now his sons had seen what way the man of God went, that came from Judah. [verse 13] And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass; and he rode thereon. [verse 14] And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am. [verse 15] Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread. [verse 16] And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place: [verse 17] for it was said to me by the word of Jehovah, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest. [verse 18] And he said unto him, I also am a prophet as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. [But] he lied unto him. [verse 19] So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water."
870,1 Kings 13:20-22,"[1 Kings] [ch 13] [verse 20] And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet that brought him back; [verse 21] and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast been disobedient unto the mouth of Jehovah, and hast not kept the commandment which Jehovah thy God commanded thee, [verse 22] but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy body shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers."
871,1 Kings 13:23-24,"[1 Kings] [ch 13] [verse 23] And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, [to wit], for the prophet whom he had brought back. [verse 24] And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his body was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it; the lion also stood by the body."
872,1 Kings 13:25-28,"[1 Kings] [ch 13] [verse 25] And, behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt. [verse 26] And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the mouth of Jehovah: therefore Jehovah hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake unto him. [verse 27] And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled it. [verse 28] And he went and found his body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the body: the lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the ass."
873,1 Kings 13:29-30,"[1 Kings] [ch 13] [verse 29] And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.

874,1 Kings 13:32,"[1 Kings] [ch 13] [verse 32] For the saying which he cried by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass."
875,1 Kings 13:33-34,"[1 Kings] [ch 13] [verse 33] After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.

[verse 3] And take with thee ten loaves, and cakes, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he will tell thee what shall become of the child."
877,1 Kings 14:5,"[1 Kings] [ch 14] [verse 5] And Jehovah said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to inquire of thee concerning her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her; for it will be, when she cometh in, that she will feign herself to be another woman."
878,1 Kings 14:6-16,"[1 Kings] [ch 14] [verse 10] therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away dung, till it be all gone. [verse 11] Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat: for Jehovah hath spoken it. [verse 12] Arise thou therefore, get thee to thy house: [and] when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die. [verse 13] And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam. [verse 14] Moreover Jehovah will raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now. [verse 15] For Jehovah will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking Jehovah to anger. [verse 16] And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he hath sinned, and wherewith he hath made Israel to sin. [verse 6] And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings. [verse 7] Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel, [verse 8] and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee; and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes, [verse 9] but hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:"
879,1 Kings 14:10-11,"[1 Kings] [ch 14] [verse 10] therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away dung, till it be all gone.

[verse 17] And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. [verse 18] Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, [verse 19] [There is] a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me. [verse 20] And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. [verse 21] And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah. [verse 22] Then king Asa made a proclamation unto all Judah; none was exempted: and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah."

[verse 14] And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah [is here] ; and he will slay me.

[verse 37] Hear me, O Jehovah, hear me, that this people may know that thou, Jehovah, art God, and [that] thou hast turned their heart back again.

[verse 4] And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread."
955,1 Kings 21:5-14,"[1 Kings] [ch 21] [verse 10] and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst curse God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him to death. [verse 11] And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them. [verse 12] They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. [verse 13] And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him: and the base fellows bare witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones. [verse 14] Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead. [verse 5] But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? [verse 6] And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee [another] vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard. [verse 7] And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. [verse 8] So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, [and] that dwelt with Naboth. [verse 9] And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:"
956,1 Kings 21:17-19,"[1 Kings] [ch 21] [verse 17] And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, [verse 18] Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwelleth in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it. [verse 19] And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast thou killed and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine."
957,1 Kings 21:19,"[1 Kings] [ch 21] [verse 19] And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast thou killed and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine."
958,1 Kings 21:20-24,"[1 Kings] [ch 21] [verse 20] And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee, because thou hast sold thyself to do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah. [verse 21] Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel: [verse 22] and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and hast made Israel to sin. [verse 23] And of Jezebel also spake Jehovah, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel. [verse 24] Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat."
959,1 Kings 21:27-29,"[1 Kings] [ch 21] [verse 27] And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. [verse 28] And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, [verse 29] Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house."
960,1 Kings 21:29,"[1 Kings] [ch 21] [verse 29] Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house."
961,1 Kings 22:1-4,"[1 Kings] [ch 22] [verse 1] And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel. [verse 2] And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. [verse 3] And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria? [verse 4] And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses."
962,1 Kings 22:5,"[1 Kings] [ch 22] [verse 5] And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah."
963,"1 Kings 22:6, 10-12","[1 Kings] [ch 22] [verse 10] Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. [verse 11] And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed. [verse 12] And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king. [verse 6] Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king."
964,1 Kings 22:13-28,"[1 Kings] [ch 22] [verse 13] And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets [declare] good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good. [verse 14] And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what Jehovah saith unto me, that will I speak. [verse 15] And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper; and Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king. [verse 16] And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah? [verse 17] And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace. [verse 18] And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil? [verse 19] And [Micaiah] said, Therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. [verse 20] And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner; and another said on that manner. [verse 21] And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him. [verse 22] And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so. [verse 23] Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee. [verse 24] Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee? [verse 25] And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. [verse 26] And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; [verse 27] and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace. [verse 28] And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you."

966,1 Kings 22:24,"[1 Kings] [ch 22] [verse 24] Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?"

968,1 Kings 22:34-35,"[1 Kings] [ch 22] [verse 34] And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded. [verse 35] And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot."
969,1 Kings 22:38,[1 Kings] [ch 22] [verse 38] And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots washed themselves [there] ); according unto the word of Jehovah which he spake.
970,1 Kings 22:43,"[1 Kings] [ch 22] [verse 43] And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; He turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah: howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places."
971,1 Kings 22:52-53,"[1 Kings] [ch 22] [verse 52] And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherein he made Israel to sin.

972,1 Kings 22:53,"[1 Kings] [ch 22] [verse 53] And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done."
973,2 Kings 1:3,"[2 Kings] [ch 1] [verse 3] But the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?"

978,2 Kings 1:16,"[2 Kings] [ch 1] [verse 16] And he said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die."
979,2 Kings 1:17,[2 Kings] [ch 1] [verse 17] So he died according to the word of Jehovah which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.

[verse 15] And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified unto them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and [went] after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom Jehovah had charged them that they should not do like them. [verse 16] And they forsook all the commandments of Jehovah their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal. [verse 17] And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger. [verse 18] Therefore Jehovah was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.

[verse 20] And Jehovah rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight. [verse 21] For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Jehovah, and made them sin a great sin. [verse 22] And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them; [verse 23] until Jehovah removed Israel out of his sight, as he spake by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day. [verse 7] And it was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against Jehovah their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods, [verse 8] and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Jehovah cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made.

[verse 22] Whom hast thou defied and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? [even] against the Holy One of Israel. [verse 23] By thy messengers thou hast defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into his farthest lodging-place, the forest of his fruitful field. [verse 24] I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt. [verse 25] Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps. [verse 26] Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blasted before it is grown up. [verse 27] But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me. [verse 28] Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest."

[verse 11] And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time. [verse 12] And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.

Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men. [verse 20] And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three. [verse 21] Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: howbeit he attained not to the [first] three. [verse 22] Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two [sons of] Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow. [verse 23] And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. [verse 24] These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men. [verse 25] Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the [first] three: and David set him over his guard.

[verse 23] And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken. [verse 24] And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee. [verse 25] For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found [in his heart] to pray before thee.

[verse 18] And according to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; [verse 19] and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty; [verse 20] and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were mentioned by name."

[verse 28] And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto Jehovah, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers. [verse 29] Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers' [houses] of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah. [verse 30] So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God."

1351,Nehemiah 1:1-4,"[Nehemiah] [ch 1] [verse 1] The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, [verse 2] that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. [verse 3] And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.

Yea, I and my father's house have sinned: [verse 7] we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses. [verse 8] Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples: [verse 9] but if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there."

Then I was very sore afraid. [verse 3] And I said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?

[verse 12] And it came to pass that, when the Jews that dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times from all places, Ye must return unto us. [verse 13] Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set [there] the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows. [verse 14] And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses. [verse 15] And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.

[verse 2] And Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. [verse 3] And he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were [attentive] unto the book of the law. [verse 4] And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, [and] Meshullam. [verse 5] And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up: [verse 6] and Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with the lifting up of their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped Jehovah with their faces to the ground. [verse 7] Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people [stood] in their place.

1369,Nehemiah 8:9-11,"[Nehemiah] [ch 8] [verse 10] Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye grieved; for the joy of Jehovah is your [ strength. [verse 11] So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved. [verse 9] And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto Jehovah your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law."

[verse 14] And they found written in the law, how that Jehovah had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month; [verse 15] and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written."
1372,Nehemiah 8:17,"[Nehemiah] [ch 8] [verse 17] And all the assembly of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths; for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness."

1374,Nehemiah 9:5-37,"[Nehemiah] [ch 9] [verse 10] and showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them, and didst get thee a name, as it is this day. [verse 11] And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters. [verse 12] Moreover in a pillar of cloud thou leddest them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way wherein they should go. [verse 13] Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments, [verse 14] and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses thy servant, [verse 15] and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commandedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them. [verse 16] But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to thy commandments, [verse 17] and refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and forsookest them not. [verse 18] Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; [verse 19] yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go. [verse 20] Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. [verse 21] Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, [and] they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not. [verse 22] Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, which thou didst allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. [verse 23] Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land concerning which thou didst say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it. [verse 24] So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would. [verse 25] And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness. [verse 26] Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and slew thy prophets that testified against them to turn them again unto thee, and they wrought great provocations. [verse 27] Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries. [verse 28] But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee; therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies, [verse 29] and testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law. Yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thine ordinances, (which if a man do, he shall live in them), and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear. [verse 30] Yet many years didst thou bear with them, and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. [verse 31] Nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou didst not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God. [verse 32] Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and lovingkindness, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day. [verse 33] Howbeit thou art just in all that is come upon us; for thou hast dealt truly, but we have done wickedly; [verse 34] neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou didst testify against them. [verse 35] For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works. [verse 36] Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it. [verse 37] And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress. [verse 5] Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, [and] Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Jehovah your God from everlasting to everlasting; and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise. [verse 6] Thou art Jehovah, even thou alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee. [verse 7] Thou art Jehovah the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham, [verse 8] and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it unto his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous. [verse 9] And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea,"
1375,"Nehemiah 9:19, 27, 31","[Nehemiah] [ch 9] [verse 19] yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go. [verse 27] Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries. [verse 31] Nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou didst not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God."

[verse 28] But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee; therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies,"

1380,Nehemiah 12:24-47,"[Nehemiah] [ch 12] [verse 24] And the chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, watch next to watch. [verse 25] Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the watch at the store-houses of the gates. [verse 26] These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest the scribe. [verse 27] And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps. [verse 28] And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites; [verse 29] also from Beth-gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem. [verse 30] And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall. [verse 31] Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession; [whereof one went] on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate: [verse 32] and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah, [verse 33] and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, [verse 34] Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, [verse 35] and certain of the priests' sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph; [verse 36] and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them. [verse 37] And by the fountain gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward. [verse 38] And the other company of them that gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, upon the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even unto the broad wall, [verse 39] and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard. [verse 40] So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me; [verse 41] and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets; [verse 42] and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer. [verse 43] And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off. [verse 44] And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited. [verse 45] And they kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, and [so did] the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son. [verse 46] For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God. [verse 47] And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they set apart [that which was] for the Levites; and the Levites set apart [that which was] for the sons of Aaron."

1387,Nehemiah 13:15-22,"[Nehemiah] [ch 13] [verse 15] In those days saw I in Judah some men treading wine-presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses [therewith] ; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified [against them] in the day wherein they sold victuals. [verse 16] There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. [verse 17] Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? [verse 18] Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath. [verse 19] And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. [verse 20] So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. [verse 21] Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. [verse 22] And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day.

[verse 25] And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves. [verse 26] Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin. [verse 27] Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?

1390,Esther 2:8-17,"[Esther] [ch 2] [verse 10] Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known. [verse 11] And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her. [verse 12] Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, [to wit], six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women), [verse 13] then in this wise came the maiden unto the king: whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house. [verse 14] In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name. [verse 15] Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her. [verse 16] So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. [verse 17] And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. [verse 8] So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. [verse 9] And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the king's house: and he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women."

[verse 18] But the Jews that were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth [day] thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth [day] of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. [verse 19] Therefore do the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar [a day of] gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another."
1423,Esther 9:20-32,"[Esther] [ch 9] [verse 20] And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far, [verse 21] to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, [verse 22] as the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor. [verse 23] And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them; [verse 24] because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them; [verse 25] but when [the matter] came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. [verse 26] Wherefore they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come unto them, [verse 27] the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof, and according to the appointed time thereof, every year; [verse 28] and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the remembrance of them [ perish from their seed. [verse 29] Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim. [verse 30] And he sent letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, [with] words of peace and truth, [verse 31] to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed, in the matter of the fastings and their cry.

[verse 20] Surely the mountains bring him forth food, Where all the beasts of the field do play. [verse 21] He lieth under the lotus-trees, In the covert of the reed, and the fen. [verse 22] The lotus-trees cover him with their shade; The willows of the brook compass him about. [verse 23] Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not; He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.

Who shall come within his jaws? [verse 14] Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror. [verse 15] [ His] strong scales are [his] pride, Shut up together [as with] a close seal. [verse 16] One is so near to another, That no air can come between them. [verse 17] They are joined one to another; They stick together, so that they cannot be sundered. [verse 18] His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. [verse 19] Out of his mouth go burning torches, And sparks of fire leap forth. [verse 2] Canst thou put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook? [verse 20] Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, As of a boiling pot and [burning] rushes. [verse 21] His breath kindleth coals, And a flame goeth forth from his mouth. [verse 22] In his neck abideth strength, And terror danceth before him. [verse 23] The flakes of his flesh are joined together: They are firm upon him; They cannot be moved. [verse 24] His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea, firm as the nether millstone. [verse 25] When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: By reason of consternation they are beside themselves. [verse 26] If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft. [verse 27] He counteth iron as straw, [And] brass as rotten wood. [verse 28] The arrow cannot make him flee: Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble. [verse 29] Clubs are counted as stubble: He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin. [verse 3] Will he make many supplications unto thee? Or will he speak soft words unto thee? [verse 30] His underparts are [like] sharp potsherds: He spreadeth [as it were] a threshing-wain upon the mire. [verse 31] He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. [verse 32] He maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary. [verse 33] Upon earth there is not his like, That is made without fear. [verse 34] He beholdeth everything that is high: He is king over all the sons of pride. [verse 4] Will he make a covenant with thee, That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever? [verse 5] Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? [verse 6] Will the bands [of fishermen] make traffic of him? Will they part him among the merchants? [verse 7] Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons, Or his head with fish-spears?

[verse 19] And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans' pride, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. [verse 2] Set ye up an ensign upon the bare mountain, lift up the voice unto them, wave the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. [verse 20] It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall shepherds make their flocks to lie down there. [verse 21] But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and ostriches shall dwell there, and wild goats shall dance there. [verse 22] And wolves shall cry in their castles, and jackals in the pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged. [verse 3] I have commanded my consecrated ones, yea, I have called my mighty men for mine anger, even my proudly exulting ones. [verse 4] The noise of a multitude in the mountains, as of a great people! the noise of a tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! Jehovah of hosts is mustering the host for the battle. [verse 5] They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven, even Jehovah, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. [verse 6] Wail ye; for the day of Jehovah is at hand; as destruction from the Almighty shall it come. [verse 7] Therefore shall all hands be feeble, and every heart of man shall melt: [verse 8] and they shall be dismayed; pangs and sorrows shall take hold [of them] ; they shall be in pain as a woman in travail: they shall look in amazement one at another; their faces [shall be] faces of flame. [verse 9] Behold, the day of Jehovah cometh, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger; to make the land a desolation, and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it."
1765,Isaiah 14:12-15,"[Isaiah] [ch 14] [verse 12] How art thou fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, that didst lay low the nations! [verse 13] And thou saidst in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I will sit upon the mount of congregation, in the uttermost parts of the north; [verse 14] I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High. [verse 15] Yet thou shalt be brought down to Sheol, to the uttermost parts of the pit."
1766,Isaiah 14:24-27,"[Isaiah] [ch 14] [verse 24] Jehovah of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely, as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand: [verse 25] that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulder. [verse 26] This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations. [verse 27] For Jehovah of hosts hath purposed, and who shall annul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?"
1767,Isaiah 38:1-5,"[Isaiah] [ch 38] [verse 1] In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live. [verse 2] Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto Jehovah, [verse 3] and said, Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. [verse 4] Then came the word of Jehovah to Isaiah, saying, [verse 5] Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years."
1768,Isaiah 38:7-8,"[Isaiah] [ch 38] [verse 7] And this shall be the sign unto thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do this thing that he hath spoken: [verse 8] behold, I will cause the shadow on the steps, which is gone down on the dial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps. So the sun returned ten steps on the dial whereon it was gone down."
1769,Isaiah 37:36,"[Isaiah] [ch 37] [verse 36] And the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies."
1770,Isaiah 37:37,"[Isaiah] [ch 37] [verse 37] So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh."
1771,Isaiah 41:8-9,"[Isaiah] [ch 41] [verse 8] But thou, Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend, [verse 9] thou whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called from the corners thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee and not cast thee away;"
1772,Isaiah 41:10-14,"[Isaiah] [ch 41] [verse 10] Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God; I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. [verse 11] Behold, all they that are incensed against thee shall be put to shame and confounded: they that strive with thee shall be as nothing, and shall perish. [verse 12] Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contend with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought. [verse 13] For I, Jehovah thy God, will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee. [verse 14] Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith Jehovah, and thy Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel."
1773,Isaiah 41:18-19,"[Isaiah] [ch 41] [verse 18] I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water. [verse 19] I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will set in the desert the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together:"
1774,Isaiah 44:28; 45:1-4,"[Isaiah] [ch 44] [verse 28] That saith of Cyrus, [He is] my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure, even saying of Jerusalem, She shall be built; and of the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid."
1775,Isaiah 46:9-11,"[Isaiah] [ch 46] [verse 10] declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not [yet] done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure; [verse 11] calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it. [verse 9] Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; [I am] God, and there is none like me;"
1776,Isaiah 53:4-6,"[Isaiah] [ch 53] [verse 4] Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. [verse 5] But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. [verse 6] All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and Jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all."
1777,Isaiah 53:10-12,"[Isaiah] [ch 53] [verse 10] Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see [his] seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand. [verse 11] He shall see of the travail of his soul, [and] shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many; and he shall bear their iniquities. [verse 12] Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bare the sin of many, and [ made intercession for the transgressors."
1778,Isaiah 54:1-3,"[Isaiah] [ch 54] [verse 1] Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith Jehovah. [verse 2] Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations; spare not: lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes. [verse 3] For thou shalt spread abroad on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited."
1779,Isaiah 55:10-11,"[Isaiah] [ch 55] [verse 10] For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, and giveth seed to the sower and bread to the eater; [verse 11] so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it."
1780,Isaiah 55:12,"[Isaiah] [ch 55] [verse 12] For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing; and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands."
1781,Isaiah 56:3-7,"[Isaiah] [ch 56] [verse 3] Neither let the foreigner, that hath joined himself to Jehovah, speak, saying, Jehovah will surely separate me from his people; neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree. [verse 4] For thus saith Jehovah of the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and hold fast my covenant: [verse 5] Unto them will I give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off. [verse 6] Also the foreigners that join themselves to Jehovah, to minister unto him, and to love the name of Jehovah, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and holdeth fast my covenant; [verse 7] even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples."
1782,Isaiah 59:15-19,"[Isaiah] [ch 59] [verse 15] Yea, truth is lacking; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice. [verse 16] And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it upheld him. [verse 17] And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle. [verse 18] According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense. [verse 19] So shall they fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Jehovah driveth."
1783,Isaiah 61:1-3,"[Isaiah] [ch 61] [verse 1] The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening [of the prison] to them that are bound; [verse 2] to proclaim the year of Jehovah's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; [verse 3] to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that he may be glorified."
1784,Isaiah 65:17,"[Isaiah] [ch 65] [verse 17] For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind."
1785,Isaiah 65:18-19,"[Isaiah] [ch 65] [verse 18] But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.

1786,Isaiah 65:25,"[Isaiah] [ch 65] [verse 25] The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith Jehovah."
1787,Isaiah 66:1,"[Isaiah] [ch 66] [verse 1] Thus saith Jehovah, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what manner of house will ye build unto me? and what place shall be my rest?"
1788,Isaiah 66:12,"[Isaiah] [ch 66] [verse 12] For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream: and ye shall suck [thereof] ; ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees."
1789,Isaiah 66:18-19,"[Isaiah] [ch 66] [verse 18] For I [know] their works and their thoughts: [the time] cometh, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and shall see my glory. [verse 19] And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations."
1790,Isaiah 66:22,"[Isaiah] [ch 66] [verse 22] For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain."
1791,Jeremiah 1:1-3,"[Jeremiah] [ch 1] [verse 1] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: [verse 2] to whom the word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. [verse 3] It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month."
1792,Jeremiah 1:4-5,"[Jeremiah] [ch 1] [verse 4] Now the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 5] Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee; I have appointed thee a prophet unto the nations."
1793,Jeremiah 1:5-10,"[Jeremiah] [ch 1] [verse 10] see, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant. [verse 5] Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee; I have appointed thee a prophet unto the nations. [verse 6] Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, I know not how to speak; for I am a child. [verse 7] But Jehovah said unto me, Say not, I am a child; for to whomsoever I shall send thee thou shalt go, and whatsoever I shall command thee thou shalt speak. [verse 8] Be not afraid because of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith Jehovah. [verse 9] Then Jehovah put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth:"
1794,Jeremiah 1:11-12,"[Jeremiah] [ch 1] [verse 11] Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree. [verse 12] Then said Jehovah unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I watch over my word to perform it."
1795,Jeremiah 1:13-16,"[Jeremiah] [ch 1] [verse 13] And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a boiling caldron; and the face thereof is from the north. [verse 14] Then Jehovah said unto me, Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land. [verse 15] For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith Jehovah; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah. [verse 16] And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands. ["
1796,Jeremiah 1:17-19,"[Jeremiah] [ch 1] [verse 17] Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at them, lest I dismay thee before them. [verse 18] For, behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land. [verse 19] And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to deliver thee."
1797,Jeremiah 2:1-3:5,"[Jeremiah] [ch 2] [verse 1] And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, [verse 10] For pass over to the isles of Kittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there hath been such a thing. [verse 11] Hath a nation changed [its] gods, which yet are no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit. [verse 12] Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith Jehovah. [verse 13] For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water. [verse 14] Is Israel a servant? is he a home-born [slave] ? why is he become a prey? [verse 15] The young lions have roared upon him, and yelled; and they have made his land waste: his cities are burned up, without inhabitant. [verse 16] The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of thy head. [verse 17] Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, when he led thee by the way? [verse 18] And now what hast thou to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? or what hast thou to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River? [ [verse 19] Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter, that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts. [verse 2] Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals; how thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown. [verse 20] For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bonds; and thou saidst, I will not serve; for upon every high hill and under every green tree thou didst bow thyself, playing the harlot. [verse 21] Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine unto me? [verse 22] For though thou wash thee with lye, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 23] How canst thou say, I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: [thou art] a swift dromedary traversing her ways; [verse 24] a wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind in her desire; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her. [verse 25] Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, It is in vain; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go. [verse 26] As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets; [verse 27] who say to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us. [verse 28] But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah. [verse 29] Wherefore will ye contend with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith Jehovah. [verse 3] Israel [was] holiness unto Jehovah, the first-fruits of his increase: all that devour him shall be held guilty; evil shall come upon them, saith Jehovah. [verse 30] In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion. [verse 31] O generation, see ye the word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? or a land of thick darkness? wherefore say my people, We are broken loose; we will come no more unto thee? [verse 32] Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number. [verse 33] How trimmest thou thy way to seek love! therefore even the wicked women hast thou taught thy ways. [verse 34] Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: thou didst not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things. [verse 35] Yet thou saidst, I am innocent; surely his anger is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned. [verse 36] Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt also, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria. [verse 37] From thence also shalt thou go forth, with thy hands upon thy head: for Jehovah hath rejected those in whom thou trustest, and thou shalt not prosper with them. [verse 4] Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel: [verse 5] thus saith Jehovah, What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain? [verse 6] Neither said they, Where is Jehovah that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed through, and where no man dwelt? [verse 7] And I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination. [verse 8] The priests said not, Where is Jehovah? and they that handle the law knew me not: the rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit. [verse 9] Wherefore I will yet contend with you, saith Jehovah, and with your children's children will I contend. [ch 3] [verse 1] They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, will he return unto her again? will not that land be greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith Jehovah. [verse 2] Lift up thine eyes unto the bare heights, and see; where hast thou not been lain with? By the ways hast thou sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness. [verse 3] Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; yet thou hast a harlot's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed. [verse 4] Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of my youth? [verse 5] Will he retain [his anger] for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and hast done evil things, and hast had thy way."
1798,Jeremiah 3:6-4:4,"[Jeremiah] [ch 3] [verse 10] And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith Jehovah. [verse 11] And Jehovah said unto me, Backsliding Israel hath showed herself more righteous than treacherous Judah. [verse 12] Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith Jehovah; I will not look in anger upon you; for I am merciful, saith Jehovah, I will not keep [anger] for ever. [verse 13] Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against Jehovah thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith Jehovah. [verse 14] Return, O backsliding children, saith Jehovah; for I am a husband unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion: [verse 15] and I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. [verse 16] And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith Jehovah, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah; neither shall it come to mind; neither shall they remember it; neither shall they miss it; neither shall it be made any more. [verse 17] At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart. [verse 18] In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance unto your fathers. [verse 19] But I said, How I will put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of the nations! and I said, Ye shall call me My Father, and shall not turn away from following me. [verse 20] Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah. [verse 21] A voice is heard upon the bare heights, the weeping [and] the supplications of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Jehovah their God. [verse 22] Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we are come unto thee; for thou art Jehovah our God. [verse 23] Truly in vain is [the help that is looked for] from the hills, the tumult on the mountains: truly in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel. [verse 24] But the shameful thing hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. [verse 25] Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day; and we have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God. [verse 6] Moreover Jehovah said unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot. [verse 7] And I said after she had done all these things, She will return unto me; but she returned not: and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. [verse 8] And I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not; but she also went and played the harlot. [verse 9] And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks. [ch 4] [verse 1] If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith Jehovah, if thou wilt return unto me, and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight; then shalt thou not be removed; [verse 2] and thou shalt swear, As Jehovah liveth, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory. [verse 3] For thus saith Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. [verse 4] Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings."
1799,Jeremiah 4:5-6:30,"[Jeremiah] [ch 4] [verse 10] Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the life. [verse 11] At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse; [verse 12] a full wind from these shall come for me: now will I also utter judgments against them. [verse 13] Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots [shall be] as the whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are ruined. [verse 14] O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thine evil thoughts lodge within thee? [verse 15] For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth evil from the hills of Ephraim: [verse 16] make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, [that] watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah. [verse 17] As keepers of a field are they against her round about, because she hath been rebellious against me, saith Jehovah. [verse 18] Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reacheth unto thy heart. [verse 19] My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I cannot hold my peace; because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. [verse 20] Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly are my tents destroyed, [and] my curtains in a moment. [verse 21] How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet? [verse 22] For my people are foolish, they know me not; they are sottish children, and they have no understanding; they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge. [verse 23] I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. [verse 24] I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved to and fro. [verse 25] I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. [verse 26] I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of Jehovah, [and] before his fierce anger. [verse 27] For thus saith Jehovah, The whole land shall be a desolation; yet will I not make a full end. [verse 28] For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it. [verse 29] Every city fleeth for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they go into the thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwelleth therein. [verse 30] And thou, when thou art made desolate, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with scarlet, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou enlargest thine eyes with paint, in vain dost thou make thyself fair; [thy] lovers despise thee, they seek thy life. [verse 31] For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that gaspeth for breath, that spreadeth her hands, [saying], Woe is me now! for my soul fainteth before the murderers. [verse 5] Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry aloud and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities. [verse 6] Set up a standard toward Zion: flee for safety, stay not; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction. [verse 7] A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations; he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place, to make thy land desolate, that thy cities be laid waste, without inhabitant. [verse 8] For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned back from us. [verse 9] And it shall come to pass at that day, saith Jehovah, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder. [ch 5] [verse 1] Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that doeth justly, that seeketh truth; and I will pardon her. [verse 10] Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her branches; for they are not Jehovah's. [verse 11] For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith Jehovah. [verse 12] They have denied Jehovah, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine: [verse 13] and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them. [verse 14] Wherefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them. [verse 15] Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say. [verse 16] Their quiver is an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men. [verse 17] And they shall eat up thy harvest, and thy bread, [which] thy sons and thy daughters should eat; they shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds; they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees; they shall beat down thy fortified cities, wherein thou trustest, with the sword. [verse 18] But even in those days, saith Jehovah, I will not make a full end with you. [verse 19] And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah our God done all these things unto us? then shalt thou say unto them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours. [verse 2] And though they say, As Jehovah liveth; surely they swear falsely. [verse 20] Declare ye this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, [verse 21] Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; that have eyes, and see not; that have ears, and hear not: [verse 22] Fear ye not me? saith Jehovah: will ye not tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it? and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it. [verse 23] But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone. [verse 24] Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear Jehovah our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in its season; that preserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest. [verse 25] Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good from you. [verse 26] For among my people are found wicked men: they watch, as fowlers lie in wait; they set a trap, they catch men. [verse 27] As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxed rich. [verse 28] They are waxed fat, they shine: yea, they overpass in deeds of wickedness; they plead not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge. [verse 29] Shall I not visit for these things? saith Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? [verse 3] O Jehovah, do not thine eyes look upon truth? thou hast stricken them, but they were not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return. [verse 30] A wonderful and horrible thing is come to pass in the land: [verse 31] the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof? [verse 4] Then I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they know not the way of Jehovah, nor the law of their God: [verse 5] I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they know the way of Jehovah, and the law of their God. But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds. [verse 6] Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them, a leopard shall watch against their cities; every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many, [and] their backslidings are increased. [verse 7] How can I pardon thee? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods. When I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the harlots' houses. [verse 8] They were as fed horses roaming at large; every one neighed after his neighbor's wife. [verse 9] Shall I not visit for these things? saith Jehovah; and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? [ch 6] [verse 1] Flee for safety, ye children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looketh forth from the north, and a great destruction. [verse 10] To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it. [verse 11] Therefore I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days. [verse 12] And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah. [verse 13] For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. [verse 14] They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. [verse 15] Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah. [verse 16] Thus saith Jehovah, Stand ye in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We will not walk [therein] . [verse 17] And I set watchmen over you, [saying], Hearken to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not hearken. [verse 18] Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them. [verse 19] Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it. [verse 2] The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off. [verse 20] To what purpose cometh there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me. [verse 21] Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish. [verse 22] Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a people cometh from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth. [verse 23] They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion. [verse 24] We have heard the report thereof; our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail. [verse 25] Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, [and] terror, are on every side. [verse 26] O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us. [verse 27] I have made thee a trier [and] a fortress among my people; that thou mayest know and try their way. [verse 28] They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly. [verse 29] The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away. [verse 3] Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place. [verse 30] Refuse silver shall men them, because Jehovah hath rejected them. [verse 4] Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day declineth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out. [verse 5] Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces. [verse 6] For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her. [verse 7] As a well casteth forth its waters, so she casteth forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds. [verse 8] Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited. [verse 9] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets."
1800,Jeremiah 7:1-2,"[Jeremiah] [ch 7] [verse 1] The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying, [verse 2] Stand in the gate of Jehovah's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of Jehovah, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship Jehovah."
1801,Jeremiah 7:3-15,"[Jeremiah] [ch 7] [verse 10] and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered; that ye may do all these abominations? [verse 11] Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, saith Jehovah. [verse 12] But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. [verse 13] And now, because ye have done all these works, saith Jehovah, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not: [verse 14] therefore will I do unto the house which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh. [verse 15] And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim. [verse 3] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. [verse 4] Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, are these. [verse 5] For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor; [verse 6] if ye oppress not the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your own hurt: [verse 7] then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even for evermore. [verse 8] Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit. [verse 9] Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods that ye have not known,"
1802,Jeremiah 7:16,"[Jeremiah] [ch 7] [verse 16] Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I will not hear thee."
1803,Jeremiah 24:1-10,"[Jeremiah] [ch 24] [verse 1] Jehovah showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. [verse 10] And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers. [verse 2] One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. [verse 3] Then said Jehovah unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad. [verse 4] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 5] Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good. [verse 6] For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up. [verse 7] And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return unto me with their whole heart. [verse 8] And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad, surely thus saith Jehovah, So will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt, [verse 9] I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them."
1804,Jeremiah 25:8-14,"[Jeremiah] [ch 25] [verse 10] Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp. [verse 11] And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. [verse 12] And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith Jehovah, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it desolate for ever. [verse 13] And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations. [verse 14] For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them, even of them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands. [verse 8] Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Because ye have not heard my words, [verse 9] behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith Jehovah, and [I will send] unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations."
1805,Jeremiah 25:15-29,"[Jeremiah] [ch 25] [verse 15] For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto me: take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it. [verse 16] And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them. [verse 17] Then took I the cup at Jehovah's hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom Jehovah had sent me: [verse 18] [ to wit], Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day; [verse 19] Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people; [verse 20] and all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of the Uz, and all the kings of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod; [verse 21] Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon; [verse 22] and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea; [verse 23] Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that have the corners [of their hair] cut off; [verse 24] and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the wilderness; [verse 25] and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes; [verse 26] and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them. [verse 27] And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you. [verse 28] And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ye shall surely drink. [verse 29] For, lo, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith Jehovah of hosts."
1806,Jeremiah 27:1-2,"[Jeremiah] [ch 27] [verse 1] In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying, [verse 2] Thus saith Jehovah to me: Make thee bonds and bars, and put them upon thy neck;"
1807,Jeremiah 28:1-17,"[Jeremiah] [ch 28] [verse 1] And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of Jehovah, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying, [verse 10] Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it. [verse 11] And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way. [verse 12] Then the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, [verse 13] Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast broken the bars of wood; but thou hast made in their stead bars of iron. [verse 14] For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also. [verse 15] Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie. [verse 16] Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast spoken rebellion against Jehovah. [verse 17] So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month. [verse 2] Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. [verse 3] Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Jehovah's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon: [verse 4] and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went to Babylon, saith Jehovah; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. [verse 5] Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of Jehovah, [verse 6] even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: Jehovah do so; Jehovah perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Jehovah's house, and all them of the captivity, from Babylon unto this place. [verse 7] Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people: [verse 8] The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. [verse 9] The prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that Jehovah hath truly sent him."
1808,Jeremiah 28:15-17,"[Jeremiah] [ch 28] [verse 15] Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie. [verse 16] Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast spoken rebellion against Jehovah. [verse 17] So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month."
1809,Jeremiah 29:1-3,"[Jeremiah] [ch 29] [verse 1] Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon, [verse 2] (after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen-mother, and the eunuchs, [and] the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem,) [verse 3] by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,) saying,"
1810,Jeremiah 29:10-14,"[Jeremiah] [ch 29] [verse 10] For thus saith Jehovah, After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. [verse 11] For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith Jehovah, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope in your latter end. [verse 12] And ye shall call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. [verse 13] And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. [verse 14] And I will be found of you, saith Jehovah, and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith Jehovah; and I will bring you again unto the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive."
1811,Jeremiah 29:24-32,"[Jeremiah] [ch 29] [verse 24] And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt speak, saying, [verse 25] Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thine own name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying, [verse 26] Jehovah hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in the house of Jehovah, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in shackles. [verse 27] Now therefore, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you, [verse 28] forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon, saying, [The captivity] is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them? [verse 29] And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet. [verse 30] Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying, [verse 31] Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he hath caused you to trust in a lie; [verse 32] therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell among this people, neither shall he behold the good that I will do unto my people, saith Jehovah, because he hath spoken rebellion against Jehovah."
1812,Jeremiah 32:6-15,"[Jeremiah] [ch 32] [verse 10] And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. [verse 11] So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, [according to] the law and custom, and that which was open: [verse 12] and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle's [son], and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard. [verse 13] And I charged Baruch before them, saying, [verse 14] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days. [verse 15] For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land. [verse 6] And Jeremiah said, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 7] Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is thine to buy it. [verse 8] So Hanamel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah. [verse 9] And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle's son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver."
1813,Jeremiah 32:16-44,"[Jeremiah] [ch 32] [verse 16] Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto Jehovah, saying, [verse 17] Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for thee, [verse 18] who showest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty God, Jehovah of hosts is his name; [verse 19] great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings: [verse 20] who didst set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, both in Israel and among [other] men; and madest thee a name, as at this day; [verse 21] and didst bring forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror; [verse 22] and gavest them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; [verse 23] and they came in, and possessed it, but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them. [verse 24] Behold, the mounds, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it. [verse 25] And thou hast said unto me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy thee the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. [verse 26] Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying, [verse 27] Behold, I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me? [verse 28] Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it: [verse 29] and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink-offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger. [verse 30] For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith Jehovah. [verse 31] For this city hath been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face, [verse 32] because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. [verse 33] And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction. [verse 34] But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it. [verse 35] And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through [the fire] unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin. [verse 36] And now therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: [verse 37] Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely: [verse 38] and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: [verse 39] and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them: [verse 40] and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me. [verse 41] Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul. [verse 42] For thus saith Jehovah: Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them. [verse 43] And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. [verse 44] Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith Jehovah."
1814,Jeremiah 33:1-3,"[Jeremiah] [ch 33] [verse 1] Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying, [verse 2] Thus saith Jehovah that doeth it, Jehovah that formeth it to establish it; Jehovah is his name: [verse 3] Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and will show thee great things, and difficult, which thou knowest not."
1815,Jeremiah 31:31-34,"[Jeremiah] [ch 31] [verse 31] Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: [verse 32] not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, saith Jehovah. [verse 33] But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith Jehovah: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people: [verse 34] and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith Jehovah: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more."
1816,Jeremiah 11:18-23,"[Jeremiah] [ch 11] [verse 18] And Jehovah gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then thou showedst me their doings. [verse 19] But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, [saying], Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered. [verse 20] But, O Jehovah of hosts, who judgest righteously, who triest the heart and the mind, I shall see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause. [verse 21] Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, that thou die not by our hand; [verse 22] therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine; [verse 23] and there shall be no remnant unto them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation."
1817,Jeremiah 12:1-6,"[Jeremiah] [ch 12] [verse 1] Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, when I contend with thee; yet would I reason the cause with thee: wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they at ease that deal very treacherously? [verse 2] Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their heart. [verse 3] But thou, O Jehovah, knowest me; thou seest me, and triest my heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter. [verse 4] How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end. [verse 5] If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and though in a land of peace thou art secure, yet how wilt thou do in the pride of the Jordan? [verse 6] For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; even they have cried aloud after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee. ["
1818,Jeremiah 16:1-4,"[Jeremiah] [ch 16] [verse 1] The word of Jehovah came also unto me, saying, [verse 2] Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters, in this place. [verse 3] For thus saith Jehovah concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land: [verse 4] They shall die grievous deaths: they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground; and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth."
1819,Jeremiah 18:1-6,"[Jeremiah] [ch 18] [verse 1] The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying, [verse 2] Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words. [verse 3] Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he was making a work on the wheels. [verse 4] And when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it. [verse 5] Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, [verse 6] O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith Jehovah. Behold, as the clay in the potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, O house of Israel."
1820,Jeremiah 18:18-23,"[Jeremiah] [ch 18] [verse 18] Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words. [verse 19] Give heed to me, O Jehovah, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me. [verse 20] Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before thee to speak good for them, to turn away thy wrath from them. [verse 21] Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and give them over to the power of the sword; and let their wives become childless, and widows; and let their men be slain of death, [and] their young men smitten of the sword in battle. [verse 22] Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them; for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet. [verse 23] Yet, Jehovah, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me; forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight; but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thou with them in the time of thine anger."
1821,Jeremiah 19:1-15,"[Jeremiah] [ch 19] [verse 1] Thus said Jehovah, Go, and buy a potter's earthen bottle, and [take] of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests; [verse 10] Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee, [verse 11] and shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again; and they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place to bury. [verse 12] Thus will I do unto this place, saith Jehovah, and to the inhabitants thereof, even making this city as Topheth: [verse 13] and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, shall be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink-offerings unto other gods. [verse 14] Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, whither Jehovah had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of Jehovah's house, and said to all the people: [verse 15] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it; because they have made their neck stiff, that they may not hear my words. [verse 2] and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee; [verse 3] and say, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle. [verse 4] Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, that they knew not, they and their fathers and the kings of Judah; and have filled this place with the blood of innocents, [verse 5] and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt-offerings unto Baal; which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind: [verse 6] therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter. [verse 7] And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth. [verse 8] And I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof. [verse 9] And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters; and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend, in the siege and in the distress, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their life, shall distress them."
1822,Jeremiah 20:1-6,"[Jeremiah] [ch 20] [verse 1] Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of Jehovah, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things. [verse 2] Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of Jehovah. [verse 3] And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, Jehovah hath not called thy name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib. [verse 4] For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword. [verse 5] Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the precious things thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they shall make them a prey, and take them, and carry them to Babylon. [verse 6] And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity; and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely."
1823,Jeremiah 21:1-10,"[Jeremiah] [ch 21] [verse 1] The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashhur the son of Malchijah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying, [verse 10] For I have set my face upon this city for evil, and not for good, saith Jehovah: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire. [verse 2] Inquire, I pray thee, of Jehovah for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us: peradventure Jehovah will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us. [verse 3] Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: [verse 4] Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans that besiege you, without the walls; and I will gather them into the midst of this city. [verse 5] And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation. [verse 6] And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence. [verse 7] And afterward, saith Jehovah, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, even such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy. [verse 8] And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. [verse 9] He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth out, and passeth over to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey."
1824,Jeremiah 23:1-8,"[Jeremiah] [ch 23] [verse 1] Woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith Jehovah. [verse 2] Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, against the shepherds that feed my people: Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them; behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith Jehovah. [verse 3] And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply. [verse 4] And I will set up shepherds over them, who shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be lacking, saith Jehovah. [verse 5] Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. [verse 6] In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be called: Jehovah our righteousness. [verse 7] Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that they shall no more say, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; [verse 8] but, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries whither I had driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land."
1825,Jeremiah 23:9-40,"[Jeremiah] [ch 23] [verse 10] For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. And their course is evil, and their might is not right; [verse 11] for both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith Jehovah. [verse 12] Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah. [verse 13] And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err. [verse 14] In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, so that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah. [verse 15] Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land. [verse 16] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they teach you vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Jehovah. [verse 17] They say continually unto them that despise me, Jehovah hath said, Ye shall have peace; and unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil shall come upon you. [verse 18] For who hath stood in the council of Jehovah, that he should perceive and hear his word? who hath marked my word, and heard it? [verse 19] Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, [even his] wrath, is gone forth, yea, a whirling tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked. [verse 20] The anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it perfectly. [verse 21] I sent not these prophets, yet they ran: I spake not unto them, yet they prophesied. [verse 22] But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings. [verse 23] Am I a God at hand, saith Jehovah, and not a God afar off? [verse 24] Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him? saith Jehovah. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith Jehovah. [verse 25] I have heard what the prophets have said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. [verse 26] How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart? [verse 27] that think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgat my name for Baal. [verse 28] The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? saith Jehovah. [verse 29] Is not my word like fire? saith Jehovah; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces? [verse 30] Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that steal my words every one from his neighbor. [verse 31] Behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that use their tongues, and say, He saith. [verse 32] Behold, I am against them that prophesy lying dreams, saith Jehovah, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting: yet I sent them not, nor commanded them; neither do they profit this people at all, saith Jehovah. [verse 33] And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of Jehovah? then shalt thou say unto them, What burden! I will cast you off, saith Jehovah. [verse 34] And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of Jehovah, I will even punish that man and his house. [verse 35] Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What hath Jehovah answered? and, What hath Jehovah spoken? [verse 36] And the burden of Jehovah shall ye mention no more: for every man's own word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of Jehovah of hosts our God. [verse 37] Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath Jehovah answered thee? and, What hath Jehovah spoken? [verse 38] But if ye say, The burden of Jehovah; therefore thus saith Jehovah: Because ye say this word, The burden of Jehovah, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of Jehovah; [verse 39] therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave unto you and to your fathers, away from my presence: [verse 40] and I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten. [verse 9] Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of Jehovah, and because of his holy words."
1826,Jeremiah 35:1-11,"[Jeremiah] [ch 35] [verse 1] The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, [verse 10] but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. [verse 11] But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we dwell at Jerusalem. [verse 2] Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of Jehovah, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink. [verse 3] Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; [verse 4] and I brought them into the house of Jehovah, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold. [verse 5] And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said unto them, Drink ye wine. [verse 6] But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons, for ever: [verse 7] neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land wherein ye sojourn. [verse 8] And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters; [verse 9] nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:"
1827,Jeremiah 35:12-19,"[Jeremiah] [ch 35] [verse 12] Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying, [verse 13] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Go, and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith Jehovah. [verse 14] The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and unto this day they drink none, for they obey their father's commandment: but I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking; and ye have not hearkened unto me. [verse 15] I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me. [verse 16] Forasmuch as the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people hath not hearkened unto me; [verse 17] therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered. [verse 18] And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he commanded you; [verse 19] therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever."
1828,Jeremiah 36:1-4,"[Jeremiah] [ch 36] [verse 1] And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying, [verse 2] Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day. [verse 3] It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. [verse 4] Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book."
1829,Jeremiah 36:19-26,"[Jeremiah] [ch 36] [verse 19] Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye are. [verse 20] And they went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king. [verse 21] So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king. [verse 22] Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month: and [there was a fire in] the brazier burning before him. [verse 23] And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that [the king] cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. [verse 24] And they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. [verse 25] Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll; but he would not hear them. [verse 26] And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah hid them."
1830,Jeremiah 36:27-32,"[Jeremiah] [ch 36] [verse 27] Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, [verse 28] Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned. [verse 29] And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast? [verse 30] Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. [verse 31] And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they hearkened not. [verse 32] Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides unto them many like words."
1831,Jeremiah 38:17-23,"[Jeremiah] [ch 38] [verse 17] Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house. [verse 18] But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand. [verse 19] And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me. [verse 20] But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of Jehovah, in that which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live. [verse 21] But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that Jehovah hath showed me: [verse 22] behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy familiar friends have set thee on, and have prevailed over thee: [now that] thy feet are sunk in the mire, they are turned away back. [verse 23] And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire."
1832,Jeremiah 38:7-13,"[Jeremiah] [ch 38] [verse 10] Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die. [verse 11] So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. [verse 12] And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so. [verse 13] So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. [verse 7] Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin,) [verse 8] Ebed-melech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king, saying, [verse 9] My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city."
1833,Jeremiah 39:15-18,"[Jeremiah] [ch 39] [verse 15] Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying, [verse 16] Go, and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before thee in that day. [verse 17] But I will deliver thee in that day, saith Jehovah; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid. [verse 18] For I will surely save thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee; because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith Jehovah."
1834,Jeremiah 39:15-18,"[Jeremiah] [ch 39] [verse 15] Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying, [verse 16] Go, and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before thee in that day. [verse 17] But I will deliver thee in that day, saith Jehovah; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid. [verse 18] For I will surely save thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee; because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith Jehovah."
1835,Jeremiah 40:13-41:18,"[Jeremiah] [ch 40] [verse 13] Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, [verse 14] and said unto him, Dost thou know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take thy life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not. [verse 15] Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he take thy life, that all the Jews that are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish? [verse 16] But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael. [ch 41] [verse 1] Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal and [one of] the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah. [verse 10] Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon. [verse 11] But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, [verse 12] then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. [verse 13] Now it came to pass that, when all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad. [verse 14] So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah. [verse 15] But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon. [verse 16] Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, [to wit], the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon: [verse 17] and they departed, and dwelt in Geruth Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt, [verse 18] because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land. [verse 2] Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. [verse 3] Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, [to wit], with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, the men of war. [verse 4] And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it, [verse 5] that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with meal-offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah. [verse 6] And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. [verse 7] And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, [and cast them] into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him. [verse 8] But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren. [verse 9] Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel,) Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain."
1836,Jeremiah 42:7-22,"[Jeremiah] [ch 42] [verse 10] If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you. [verse 11] Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith Jehovah: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand. [verse 12] And I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land. [verse 13] But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land; so that ye obey not the voice of Jehovah your God, [verse 14] saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell: [verse 15] now therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, If ye indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; [verse 16] then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, whereof ye are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die. [verse 17] So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there: they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them. [verse 18] For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: As mine anger and my wrath hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt; and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more. [verse 19] Jehovah hath spoken concerning you, O remnant of Judah, Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have testified unto you this day. [verse 20] For ye have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for ye sent me unto Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us unto Jehovah our God; and according unto all that Jehovah our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it: [verse 21] and I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah your God in anything for which he hath sent me unto you. [verse 22] Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go to sojourn there. [verse 7] And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah. [verse 8] Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, [verse 9] and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him:"
1837,Jeremiah 44:1-30,"[Jeremiah] [ch 44] [verse 1] The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, that dwelt at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying, [verse 10] They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers. [verse 11] Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah. [verse 12] And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be an execration, [and] an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach. [verse 13] For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; [verse 14] so that none of the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or be left, to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return save such as shall escape. [verse 15] Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great assembly, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, [verse 16] As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of Jehovah, we will not hearken unto thee. [verse 17] But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil. [verse 18] But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven, and pouring out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. [verse 19] And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink-offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink-offerings unto her, without our husbands? [ [verse 2] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein, [verse 20] Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people that had given him that answer, saying, [verse 21] The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not Jehovah remember them, and came it not into his mind? [verse 22] so that Jehovah could not longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day. [verse 23] Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as it is this day. [verse 24] Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of Jehovah, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt: [verse 25] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her: establish then your vows, and perform your vows. [verse 26] Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith Jehovah, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord Jehovah liveth. [verse 27] Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them. [verse 28] And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs. [verse 29] And this shall be the sign unto you, saith Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil: [verse 3] because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, [and] to serve other gods, that they knew not, neither they, nor ye, nor your fathers. [verse 30] Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy, and sought his life. [verse 4] Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate. [verse 5] But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods. [verse 6] Wherefore my wrath and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day. [verse 7] Therefore now thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Wherefore commit ye [this] great evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none remaining; [verse 8] in that ye provoke me unto anger with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are gone to sojourn; that ye may be cut off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? [verse 9] Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?"
1838,Jeremiah 46:1-28,"[Jeremiah] [ch 46] [verse 1] The word of Jehovah which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations. [verse 10] For that day is [a day] of the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour and be satiate, and shall drink its fill of their blood; for the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates. [verse 11] Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain dost thou use many medicines; there is no healing for thee. [verse 12] The nations have heard of thy shame, and the earth is full of thy cry; for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, they are fallen both of them together. [verse 13] The word that Jehovah spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt. [verse 14] Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand forth, and prepare thee; for the sword hath devoured round about thee. [verse 15] Why are thy strong ones swept away? they stood not, because Jehovah did drive them. [verse 16] He made many to stumble, yea, they fell one upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword. [verse 17] They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath let the appointed time pass by. [verse 18] As I live, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts, surely like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come. [verse 19] O thou daughter that dwellest in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity; for Memphis shall become a desolation, and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant. [verse 2] Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh-neco king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah. [verse 20] Egypt is a very fair heifer; [but] destruction out of the north is come, it is come. [verse 21] Also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall; for they also are turned back, they are fled away together, they did not stand: for the day of their calamity is come upon them, the time of their visitation. [verse 22] The sound thereof shall go like the serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood. [verse 23] They shall cut down her forest, saith Jehovah, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the locusts, and are innumerable. [verse 24] The daughter of Egypt shall be put to shame; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north. [verse 25] Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saith: Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with her gods, and her kings; even Pharaoh, and them that trust in him: [verse 26] and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants; and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith Jehovah. [verse 27] But fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid. [verse 28] Fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, saith Jehovah; for I am with thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee; but I will not make a full end of thee, but I will correct thee in measure, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished. [verse 3] Prepare ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. [verse 4] Harness the horses, and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail. [verse 5] Wherefore have I seen it? they are dismayed and are turned backward; and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: terror is on every side, saith Jehovah. [verse 6] Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled and fallen. [verse 7] Who is this that riseth up like the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers? [verse 8] Egypt riseth up like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves like the rivers: and he saith, I will rise up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy cities and the inhabitants thereof. [verse 9] Go up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men go forth: Cush and Put, that handle the shield; and the Ludim, that handle and bend the bow."
1839,Jeremiah 46:27-28,"[Jeremiah] [ch 46] [verse 27] But fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid. [verse 28] Fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, saith Jehovah; for I am with thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee; but I will not make a full end of thee, but I will correct thee in measure, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished."
1840,Jeremiah 47:1-7,"[Jeremiah] [ch 47] [verse 1] The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza. [verse 2] Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land and all that is therein, the city and them that dwell therein; and the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail. [verse 3] At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers look not back to their children for feebleness of hands; [verse 4] because of the day that cometh to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper that remaineth: for Jehovah will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor. [verse 5] Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is brought to nought, the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself? [verse 6] O thou sword of Jehovah, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard; rest, and be still. [verse 7] How canst thou be quiet, seeing Jehovah hath given thee a charge? Against Ashkelon, and against the sea-shore, there hath he appointed it."
1841,Jeremiah 48:1-47,"[Jeremiah] [ch 48] [verse 1] Of Moab. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Woe unto Nebo! for it is laid waste; Kiriathaim is put to shame, it is taken; Misgab is put to shame and broken down. [verse 10] Cursed be he that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently; and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood. [verse 11] Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remaineth in him, and his scent is not changed. [verse 12] Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will send unto him them that pour off, and they shall pour him off; and they shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles in pieces. [verse 13] And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth-el their confidence. [verse 14] How say ye, We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war? [verse 15] Moab is laid waste, and they are gone up into his cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts. [verse 16] The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast. [verse 17] All ye that are round about him, bemoan him, and all ye that know his name; say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod! [verse 18] O thou daughter that dwellest in Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the destroyer of Moab is come up against thee, he hath destroyed thy strongholds. [verse 19] O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and watch: ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth; say, What hath been done? [verse 2] The praise of Moab is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her: Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation. Thou also, O Madmen, shalt be brought to silence: the sword shall pursue thee. [verse 20] Moab is put to shame; for it is broken down: wail and cry; tell ye it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste. [verse 21] And judgment is come upon the plain country, upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath, [verse 22] and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim, [verse 23] and upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon, [verse 24] and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near. [verse 25] The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith Jehovah. [verse 26] Make ye him drunken; for he magnified himself against Jehovah: and Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision. [verse 27] For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for as often as thou speakest of him, thou waggest the head. [verse 28] O ye inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock; and be like the dove that maketh her nest over the mouth of the abyss. [verse 29] We have heard of the pride of Moab, [that] he is very proud; his loftiness, and his pride, and his arrogancy, and the haughtiness of his heart. [verse 3] The sound of a cry from Horonaim, desolation and great destruction! [verse 30] I know his wrath, saith Jehovah, that it is nought; his boastings have wrought nothing. [verse 31] Therefore will I wail for Moab; yea, I will cry out for all Moab: for the men of Kir-heres shall they mourn. [verse 32] With more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for thee, O vine of Sibmah: thy branches passed over the sea, they reached even to the sea of Jazer: upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage the destroyer is fallen. [verse 33] And gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to cease from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; the shouting shall be no shouting. [verse 34] From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, even unto Jahaz have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, to Eglath-shelishiyah: for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate. [verse 35] Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith Jehovah, him that offereth in the high place, and him that burneth incense to his gods. [verse 36] Therefore my heart soundeth for Moab like pipes, and my heart soundeth like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: therefore the abundance that he hath gotten is perished. [verse 37] For every head is bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands are cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth. [verse 38] On all the housetops of Moab and in the streets thereof there is lamentation every where; for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein none delighteth, saith Jehovah. [verse 39] How is it broken down! [how] do they wail! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab become a derision and a terror to all that are round about him. [verse 4] Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard. [verse 40] For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread out his wings against Moab. [verse 41] Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. [verse 42] And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against Jehovah. [verse 43] Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith Jehovah. [verse 44] He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon him, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah. [verse 45] They that fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon; for a fire is gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and hath devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones. [verse 46] Woe unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh is undone; for thy sons are taken away captive, and thy daughters into captivity. [verse 47] Yet will I bring back the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith Jehovah. Thus far is the judgment of Moab. [verse 5] For by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up; for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction. [verse 6] Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness. [verse 7] For, because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity, his priests and his princes together. [verse 8] And the destroyer shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed; as Jehovah hath spoken. [verse 9] Give wings unto Moab, that she may fly and get her away: and her cities shall become a desolation, without any to dwell therein."
1842,Jeremiah 49:1-6,"[Jeremiah] [ch 49] [verse 1] Of the children of Ammon. Thus saith Jehovah: Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth Malcam possess Gad, and his people dwell in the cities thereof? [verse 2] Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess them that did possess him, saith Jehovah. [verse 3] Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and run to and fro among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together. [verse 4] Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, [saying], Who shall come unto me? [verse 5] Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, from all that are round about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives. [verse 6] But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith Jehovah."
1843,Jeremiah 49:7-22,"[Jeremiah] [ch 49] [verse 10] But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brethren, and his neighbors; and he is not. [verse 11] Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me. [verse 12] For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink. [verse 13] For I have sworn by myself, saith Jehovah, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes. [verse 14] I have heard tidings from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, [saying], Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle. [verse 15] For, behold, I have made thee small among the nations, and despised among men. [verse 16] As for thy terribleness, the pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith Jehovah. [verse 17] And Edom shall become an astonishment: every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. [verse 18] As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein. [verse 19] Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that will stand before me? [verse 20] Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them. [verse 21] The earth trembleth at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea. [verse 22] Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. [verse 7] Of Edom. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished? [verse 8] Flee ye, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I shall visit him. [verse 9] If grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough?"
1844,Jeremiah 49:23-27,"[Jeremiah] [ch 49] [verse 23] Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet. [verse 24] Damascus is waxed feeble, she turneth herself to flee, and trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail. [verse 25] How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy? [verse 26] Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts. [verse 27] And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad."
1845,Jeremiah 49:28-33,"[Jeremiah] [ch 49] [verse 28] Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote. Thus saith Jehovah: Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east. [verse 29] Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Terror on every side! [verse 30] Flee ye, wander far off, dwell in the depths, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith Jehovah; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. [verse 31] Arise, get you up unto a nation that is at ease, that dwelleth without care, saith Jehovah; that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone. [verse 32] And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter unto all winds them that have the corners [of their hair] cut off; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, saith Jehovah. [verse 33] And Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals, a desolation for ever: no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein."
1846,Jeremiah 49:34-39,"[Jeremiah] [ch 49] [verse 34] The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, [verse 35] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might. [verse 36] And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. [verse 37] And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith Jehovah; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them; [verse 38] and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence king and princes, saith Jehovah. [verse 39] But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, saith Jehovah."
1847,Jeremiah 50:1-51:64,"[Jeremiah] [ch 50] [verse 1] The word that Jehovah spake concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet. [verse 10] And Chaldea shall be a prey: all that prey upon her shall be satisfied, saith Jehovah. [verse 11] Because ye are glad, because ye rejoice, O ye that plunder my heritage, because ye are wanton as a heifer that treadeth out [the grain], and neigh as strong horses; [verse 12] your mother shall be utterly put to shame; she that bare you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the hindermost of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. [verse 13] Because of the wrath of Jehovah she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. [verse 14] Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against Jehovah. [verse 15] Shout against her round about: she hath submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Jehovah: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her. [verse 16] Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land. [verse 17] Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. [verse 18] Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. [verse 19] And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead. [verse 2] Declare ye among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed; her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed. [verse 20] In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant. [verse 21] Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: slay and utterly destroy after them, saith Jehovah, and do according to all that I have commanded thee. [verse 22] A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction. [verse 23] How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! [verse 24] I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against Jehovah. [verse 25] Jehovah hath opened his armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a work [to do] in the land of the Chaldeans. [verse 26] Come against her from the utmost border; open her store-houses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left. [ [verse 27] Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. [verse 28] The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of his temple. [verse 29] Call together the archers against Babylon, all them that bend the bow; encamp against her round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her; for she hath been proud against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel. [verse 3] For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and beast. [verse 30] Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith Jehovah. [verse 31] Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts; for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee. [verse 32] And the proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that are round about him. [verse 33] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all that took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go. [verse 34] Their Redeemer is strong; Jehovah of hosts is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon. [verse 35] A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith Jehovah, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men. [verse 36] A sword is upon the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed. [verse 37] A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed. [verse 38] A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of graven images, and they are mad over idols. [verse 39] Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. [verse 4] In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek Jehovah their God. [verse 40] As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein. [verse 41] Behold, a people cometh from the north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth. [verse 42] They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon. [verse 43] The king of Babylon hath heard the tidings of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail. [verse 44] Behold, [the enemy] shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that can stand before me? [verse 45] Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them. [verse 46] At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembleth, and the cry is heard among the nations. [verse 5] They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces thitherward, [saying], Come ye, and join yourselves to Jehovah in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten. [verse 6] My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting-place. [verse 7] All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Jehovah, the habitation of righteousness, even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers. [verse 8] Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks. [verse 9] For, lo, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain. [ch 51] [verse 1] Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in Leb-kamai, a destroying wind. [verse 10] Jehovah hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of Jehovah our God. [verse 11] Make sharp the arrows; hold firm the shields: Jehovah hath stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes; because his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it: for it is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of his temple. [verse 12] Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes; for Jehovah hath both purposed and done that which he spake concerning the inhabitants of Babylon. [verse 13] O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, the measure of thy covetousness. [verse 14] Jehovah of hosts hath sworn by himself, [saying], Surely I will fill thee with men, as with the canker-worm; and they shall lift up a shout against thee. [verse 15] He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens: [verse 16] when he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries. [verse 17] Every man is become brutish [and is] without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. [verse 18] They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. [verse 19] The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and [Israel] is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name. [verse 2] And I will send unto Babylon strangers, that shall winnow her; and they shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about. [verse 20] Thou art my battle-axe and weapons of war: and with thee will I break in pieces the nations; and with thee will I destroy kingdoms; [verse 21] and with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; [verse 22] and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and him that rideth therein; and with thee will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces the old man and the youth; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the virgin; [verse 23] and with thee will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke [of oxen] ; and with thee will I break in pieces governors and deputies. [verse 24] And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith Jehovah. [verse 25] Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith Jehovah, which destroyest all the earth; and I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain. [verse 26] And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith Jehovah. [verse 27] Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz: appoint a marshal against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough canker-worm. [verse 28] Prepare against her the nations, the kings of the Medes, the governors thereof, and all the deputies thereof, and all the land of their dominion. [verse 29] And the land trembleth and is in pain; for the purposes of Jehovah against Babylon do stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant. [verse 3] Against [him that] bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against [him that] lifteth himself up in his coat of mail: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host. [verse 30] The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they remain in their strongholds; their might hath failed; they are become as women: her dwelling-places are set on fire; her bars are broken. [verse 31] One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter: [verse 32] and the passages are seized, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted. [verse 33] For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a little while, and the time of harvest shall come for her. [verse 34] Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath, like a monster, swallowed [ me up, he hath filled his maw with my delicacies; he hath cast me out. [verse 35] The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and, My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say. [verse 36] Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her fountain dry. [verse 37] And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling-place for jackals, an astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant. [verse 38] They shall roar together like young lions; they shall growl as lions' whelps. [verse 39] When they are heated, I will make their feast, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith Jehovah. [verse 4] And they shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and thrust through in her streets. [verse 40] I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats. [verse 41] How is Sheshach taken! and the praise of the whole earth seized! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! [verse 42] The sea is come up upon Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof. [verse 43] Her cities are become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby. [verse 44] And I will execute judgment upon Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up; and the nations shall not flow any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall. [verse 45] My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of Jehovah. [verse 46] And let not your heart faint, neither fear ye for the tidings that shall be heard in the land; for tidings shall come one year, and after that in another year [shall come] tidings, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler. [verse 47] Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will execute judgment upon the graven images of Babylon; and her whole land shall be confounded; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her. [verse 48] Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers shall come unto her from the north, saith Jehovah. [verse 49] As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the land. [verse 5] For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, of his God, of Jehovah of hosts; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel. [verse 50] Ye that have escaped the sword, go ye, stand not still; remember Jehovah from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind. [verse 51] We are confounded, because we have heard reproach; confusion hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of Jehovah's house. [verse 52] Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will execute judgment upon her graven images; and through all her land the wounded shall groan. [verse 53] Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall destroyers come unto her, saith Jehovah. [verse 54] The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans! [verse 55] For Jehovah layeth Babylon waste, and destroyeth out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is uttered: [verse 56] for the destroyer is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bows are broken in pieces; for Jehovah is a God of recompenses, he will surely requite. [verse 57] And I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts. [verse 58] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the peoples shall labor for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they shall be weary. [verse 59] The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain. [verse 6] Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life; be not cut off in her iniquity: for it is the time of Jehovah's vengeance; he will render unto her a recompense. [verse 60] And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon. [verse 61] And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, then see that thou read all these words, [verse 62] and say, O Jehovah, thou hast spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever. [verse 63] And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates: [verse 64] and thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring upon her; and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah. [verse 7] Babylon hath been a golden cup in Jehovah's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the nations are mad. [verse 8] Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: wail for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed. [verse 9] We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country; for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies."
1848,Jeremiah 51:59-64,"[Jeremiah] [ch 51] [verse 59] The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain. [verse 60] And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon. [verse 61] And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, then see that thou read all these words, [verse 62] and say, O Jehovah, thou hast spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever. [verse 63] And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates: [verse 64] and thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring upon her; and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah."
1849,Lamentations 2:1-9,"[Lamentations] [ch 2] [verse 1] How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger! He hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, And hath not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger. [verse 2] The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: He hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He hath brought them down to the ground; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof. [verse 3] He hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel; He hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy: And he hath burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. [verse 4] He hath bent his bow like an enemy, he hath stood with his right hand as an adversary, And hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye: In the tent of the daughter of Zion he hath poured out his wrath like fire. [verse 5] The Lord is become as an enemy, he hath swallowed up Israel; He hath swallowed up all her palaces, he hath destroyed his strongholds; And he hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation. [verse 6] And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden; he hath destroyed his place of assembly: Jehovah hath caused solemn assembly and sabbath to be forgotten in Zion, And hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest. [verse 7] The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary; He hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces: They have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as in the day of a solemn assembly. [verse 8] Jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion; He hath stretched out the line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying; And he hath made the rampart and wall to lament; they languish together. [verse 9] Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not; Yea, her prophets find no vision from Jehovah."
1850,"Lamentations 2:2, 17","[Lamentations] [ch 2] [verse 17] Jehovah hath done that which he purposed; He hath fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old; He hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: And he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; He hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries. [verse 2] The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: He hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He hath brought them down to the ground; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof."
1851,Lamentations 2:4-5,"[Lamentations] [ch 2] [verse 4] He hath bent his bow like an enemy, he hath stood with his right hand as an adversary, And hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye: In the tent of the daughter of Zion he hath poured out his wrath like fire. [verse 5] The Lord is become as an enemy, he hath swallowed up Israel; He hath swallowed up all her palaces, he hath destroyed his strongholds; And he hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation."
1852,Lamentations 2:7,"[Lamentations] [ch 2] [verse 7] The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary; He hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces: They have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as in the day of a solemn assembly."
1853,Lamentations 2:17,"[Lamentations] [ch 2] [verse 17] Jehovah hath done that which he purposed; He hath fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old; He hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: And he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; He hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries."
1854,Lamentations 3:22-23,"[Lamentations] [ch 3] [verse 22] [ It is of] Jehovah's lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. [verse 23] They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness."
1855,Lamentations 3:32-33,"[Lamentations] [ch 3] [verse 32] For though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. [verse 33] For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men."
1856,Ezekiel 1:1,"[Ezekiel] [ch 1] [verse 1] Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God."
1857,Ezekiel 1:4-28,"[Ezekiel] [ch 1] [verse 10] As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle. [verse 11] And their faces and their wings were separate above; two [wings] of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. [verse 12] And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went. [verse 13] As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: [the fire] went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. [verse 14] And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. [verse 15] Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces thereof. [verse 16] The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto a beryl: and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel. [verse 17] When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not when they went. [verse 18] As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about. [verse 19] And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. [verse 20] Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; thither was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. [verse 21] When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. [verse 22] And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the terrible crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above. [verse 23] And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies. [verse 24] And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings. [verse 25] And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings. [verse 26] And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above. [verse 27] And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him. [verse 28] As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake. [verse 4] And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst thereof as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire. [verse 5] And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man. [verse 6] And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings. [verse 7] And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass. [verse 8] And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings [thus] : [verse 9] their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward."
1858,Ezekiel 1:24-28,"[Ezekiel] [ch 1] [verse 24] And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings. [verse 25] And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings. [verse 26] And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above. [verse 27] And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him. [verse 28] As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake."

1860,Ezekiel 2:2,"[Ezekiel] [ch 2] [verse 2] And the Spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me."
1861,Ezekiel 2:3-7,"[Ezekiel] [ch 2] [verse 3] And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day. [verse 4] And the children are impudent and stiffhearted: I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 5] And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. [verse 6] And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. [verse 7] And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious."
1862,Ezekiel 2:8-3:3,"[Ezekiel] [ch 2] [verse 10] And he spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe. [verse 8] But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee. [verse 9] And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; [ch 3] [verse 1] And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel. [verse 2] So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll. [verse 3] And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness."
1863,Ezekiel 3:1-3,"[Ezekiel] [ch 3] [verse 1] And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.

Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness."
1864,Ezekiel 3:8-9,"[Ezekiel] [ch 3] [verse 8] Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads. [verse 9] As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house."
1865,"Ezekiel 3:12, 14","[Ezekiel] [ch 3] [verse 12] Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place. [verse 14] So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me."
1866,Ezekiel 3:26-27,"[Ezekiel] [ch 3] [verse 26] and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house. [verse 27] But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house."
1867,Ezekiel 8:1-18,"[Ezekiel] [ch 8] [verse 1] And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell there upon me. [verse 10] So I went in and saw; and behold, every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about. [verse 11] And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel; and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up. [verse 12] Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chambers of imagery? for they say, Jehovah seeth us not; Jehovah hath forsaken the land. [verse 13] He said also unto me, Thou shalt again see yet other great abominations which they do. [verse 14] Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Jehovah's house which was toward the north; and behold, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz. [verse 15] Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen [this], O son of man? thou shalt again see yet greater abominations than these. [verse 16] And he brought me into the inner court of Jehovah's house; and behold, at the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, and their faces toward the east; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east. [verse 17] Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen [this], O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose. [verse 18] Therefore will I also deal in wrath; mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them. [verse 2] Then I beheld, and, lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire; and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal. [verse 3] And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner [court] that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. [verse 4] And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain. [verse 5] Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. [verse 6] And he said unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But thou shalt again see yet other great abominations. [verse 7] And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall. [verse 8] Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold, a door. [verse 9] And he said unto me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here."
1868,Ezekiel 8:3,"[Ezekiel] [ch 8] [verse 3] And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner [court] that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy."
1869,Ezekiel 9:1-11,"[Ezekiel] [ch 9] [verse 1] Then he cried in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause ye them that have charge over the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand. [verse 10] And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head. [verse 11] And behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me. [verse 2] And behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lieth toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side. And they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar. [verse 3] And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer's inkhorn by his side. [verse 4] And Jehovah said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof. [verse 5] And to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye through the city after him, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity; [verse 6] slay utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men that were before the house. [verse 7] And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and smote in the city. [verse 8] And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy wrath upon Jerusalem? [verse 9] Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wresting [of judgment] : for they say, Jehovah hath forsaken the land, and Jehovah seeth not."
1870,Ezekiel 9:3-4,"[Ezekiel] [ch 9] [verse 3] And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer's inkhorn by his side. [verse 4] And Jehovah said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof."
1871,"Ezekiel 10:1-22, 11:22-23","[Ezekiel] [ch 10] [verse 1] Then I looked, and behold, in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. [verse 10] And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been within a wheel. [verse 11] When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went. [verse 12] And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, [even] the wheels that they four had. [verse 13] As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, the whirling [wheels] . [verse 14] And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. [verse 15] And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar. [verse 16] And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also turned not from beside them. [verse 17] When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them. [verse 18] And the glory of Jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim. [verse 19] And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of Jehovah's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. [verse 2] And he spake unto the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling [wheels], even under the cherub, and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight. [verse 20] This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim. [verse 21] Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. [verse 22] And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward. [verse 3] Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. [verse 4] And the glory of Jehovah mounted up from the cherub, [and stood] over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah's glory. [verse 5] And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaketh. [verse 6] And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel. [verse 7] And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took [thereof], and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen, who took it and went out. [verse 8] And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings. [verse 9] And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like unto a beryl stone. [ch 11] [verse 22] Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. [verse 23] And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city."
1872,Ezekiel 10:1-22,"[Ezekiel] [ch 10] [verse 1] Then I looked, and behold, in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. [verse 10] And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been within a wheel. [verse 11] When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.

[verse 15] And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar. [verse 16] And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also turned not from beside them. [verse 17] When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them. [verse 18] And the glory of Jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim. [verse 19] And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of Jehovah's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. [verse 2] And he spake unto the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling [wheels], even under the cherub, and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight. [verse 20] This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim. [verse 21] Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. [verse 22] And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward. [verse 3] Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. [verse 4] And the glory of Jehovah mounted up from the cherub, [and stood] over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah's glory. [verse 5] And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaketh. [verse 6] And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel. [verse 7] And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took [thereof], and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen, who took it and went out. [verse 8] And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings. [verse 9] And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like unto a beryl stone."
1873,Ezekiel 11:1,"[Ezekiel] [ch 11] [verse 1] Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Jehovah's house, which looketh eastward: and behold, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people."
1874,Ezekiel 11:5-12,"[Ezekiel] [ch 11] [verse 10] Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 11] This [city] shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; I will judge you in the border of Israel; [verse 12] and ye shall know that I am Jehovah: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither have ye executed mine ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you. [verse 5] And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and he said unto me, Speak, Thus saith Jehovah: Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind. [verse 6] Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain. [verse 7] Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this [city] is the caldron; but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it. [verse 8] Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord Jehovah.

[verse 18] And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. [verse 19] And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh; [verse 20] that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God."
1877,Ezekiel 11:24,"[Ezekiel] [ch 11] [verse 24] And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me."
1878,Ezekiel 12:1-7,"[Ezekiel] [ch 12] [verse 1] The word of Jehovah also came unto me, saying, [verse 2] Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of the rebellious house, that have eyes to see, and see not, that have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house. [verse 3] Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house. [verse 4] And thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing; and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile. [verse 5] Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby. [verse 6] In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the land: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel. [verse 7] And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bare it upon my shoulder in their sight."
1879,Ezekiel 12:8-16,"[Ezekiel] [ch 12] [verse 10] Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This burden [concerneth] the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are. [verse 11] Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them; they shall go into exile, into captivity. [verse 12] And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes. [verse 13] My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there. [verse 14] And I will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them. [verse 15] And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries. [verse 16] But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 8] And in the morning came the word of Jehovah unto me, saying, [verse 9] Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?"
1880,Ezekiel 12:17-20,"[Ezekiel] [ch 12] [verse 17] Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, [verse 18] Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness; [verse 19] and say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, [and despoiled] of all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein. [verse 20] And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah."
1881,Ezekiel 12:21-28,"[Ezekiel] [ch 12] [verse 21] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 22] Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth? [verse 23] Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the fulfilment of every vision. [verse 24] For there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel. [verse 25] For I am Jehovah; I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be performed; it shall be no more deferred: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I speak the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 26] Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, [verse 27] Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many day to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off. [verse 28] Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, saith the Lord Jehovah."
1882,Ezekiel 13:1-23,"[Ezekiel] [ch 13] [verse 1] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 10] Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and when one buildeth up a wall, behold, they daub it with untempered [mortar] : [verse 11] say unto them that daub it with untempered [mortar], that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it. [verse 12] Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it? [verse 13] Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it. [verse 14] So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered [mortar], and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered; and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 15] Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered [mortar] ; and I will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it; [verse 16] [ to wit], the prophets of Israel that prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and that see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 17] And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, that prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them, [verse 18] and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the women that sew pillows upon all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head of [persons of] every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves? [verse 19] And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hearken unto lies. [verse 2] Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah: [verse 20] Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make [them] fly, and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make [them] fly. [verse 21] Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 22] Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive; [verse 23] therefore ye shall no more see false visions, nor divine divinations: and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 3] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing! [verse 4] O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places. [verse 5] Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of Jehovah. [verse 6] They have seen falsehood and lying divination, that say, Jehovah saith; but Jehovah hath not sent them: and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed. [verse 7] Have ye not seen a false vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, in that ye say, Jehovah saith; albeit I have not spoken? [verse 8] Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have spoken falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 9] And my hand shall be against the prophets that see false visions, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah."
1883,Ezekiel 14:1-11,"[Ezekiel] [ch 14] [verse 1] Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me. [verse 10] And they shall bear their iniquity: the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that seeketh [unto him] ; [verse 11] that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 2] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 3] Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them? [verse 4] Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel that taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I Jehovah will answer him therein according to the multitude of his idols; [verse 5] that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols. [verse 6] Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations. [verse 7] For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that separateth himself from me, and taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet to inquire for himself of me; I Jehovah will answer him by myself: [verse 8] and I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 9] And if the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I, Jehovah, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel."
1884,Ezekiel 14:12-23,"[Ezekiel] [ch 14] [verse 12] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 13] Son of man, when a land sinneth against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast; [verse 14] though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 15] If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts; [verse 16] though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only should be delivered, but the land should be desolate. [verse 17] Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and beast; [verse 18] though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only should be delivered themselves. [verse 19] Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast; [verse 20] though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither son nor daughter; they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness. [verse 21] For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the evil beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast! [verse 22] Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings; and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it. [verse 23] And they shall comfort you, when ye see their way and their doings; and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord Jehovah."
1885,Ezekiel 15:1-8,"[Ezekiel] [ch 15] [verse 1] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 2] Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest? [verse 3] Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? [verse 4] Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned: is it profitable for any work? [verse 5] Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work! [verse 6] Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. [verse 7] And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set my face against them. [verse 8] And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord Jehovah."
1886,Ezekiel 16:1-63,"[Ezekiel] [ch 16] [verse 1] Again the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 10] I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with sealskin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and covered thee with silk. [verse 11] And I decked thee with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck. [verse 12] And I put a ring upon thy nose, and ear-rings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head. [verse 13] Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper unto royal estate. [verse 14] And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 15] But thou didst trust in thy beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy whoredoms on every one that passed by; his it was. [verse 16] And thou didst take of thy garments, and madest for thee high places decked with divers colors, and playedst the harlot upon them: [the like things] shall not come, neither shall it be [so] . [verse 17] Thou didst also take thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of men, and didst play the harlot with them; [verse 18] and thou tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them, and didst set mine oil and mine incense before them. [verse 19] My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savor; and [thus] it was, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 2] Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations; [verse 20] Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Were thy whoredoms a small matter, [verse 21] that thou hast slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through [the fire] unto them? [verse 22] And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast weltering in thy blood. [verse 23] And it is come to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord Jehovah,) [verse 24] that thou hast built unto thee a vaulted place, and hast made thee a lofty place in every street. [verse 25] Thou hast built thy lofty place at the head of every way, and hast made thy beauty an abomination, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredom. [verse 26] Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians, thy neighbors, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy whoredom, to provoke me to anger. [verse 27] Behold therefore, I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary [food], and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, that are ashamed of thy lewd way. [verse 28] Thou hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because thou wast insatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet thou wast not satisfied. [verse 29] Thou hast moreover multiplied thy whoredom unto the land of traffic, unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith. [verse 3] and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto Jerusalem: Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of the Canaanite; the Amorite was thy father, and thy mother was a Hittite. [verse 30] How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord Jehovah, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an impudent harlot; [verse 31] in that thou buildest thy vaulted place at the head of every way, and makest thy lofty place in every street, and hast not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest hire. [verse 32] A wife that committeth adultery! that taketh strangers instead of her husband! [verse 33] They give gifts to all harlots; but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and bribest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredoms. [verse 34] And thou art different from [other] women in thy whoredoms, in that none followeth thee to play the harlot; and whereas thou givest hire, and no hire is given unto thee, therefore thou art different. [verse 35] Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah: [verse 36] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness uncovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers; and because of all the idols of thy abominations, and for the blood of thy children, that thou didst give unto them; [verse 37] therefore behold, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them against thee on every side, and will uncover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness. [verse 38] And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon thee the blood of wrath and jealousy. [verse 39] I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thy vaulted place, and break down thy lofty places; and they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take thy fair jewels; and they shall leave thee naked and bare. [verse 4] And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to cleanse thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all. [verse 40] They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords. [verse 41] And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt also give no hire any more. [verse 42] So will I cause my wrath toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry. [verse 43] Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring thy way upon thy head, saith the Lord Jehovah: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness with all thine abominations. [verse 44] Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use [this] proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter. [verse 45] Thou art the daughter of thy mother, that loatheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite. [verse 46] And thine elder sister is Samaria, that dwelleth at thy left hand, she and her daughters; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters. [verse 47] Yet hast thou not walked in their ways, nor done after their abominations; but, as [if that were] a very little [thing], thou wast more corrupt than they in all thy ways. [verse 48] As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters. [verse 49] Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fulness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. [verse 5] No eye pitied thee, to do any of these things unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, for that thy person was abhorred, in the day that thou wast born. [verse 50] And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw [good] . [verse 51] Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done. [verse 52] Thou also, bear thou thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters; through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous that thou: yea, be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters. [verse 53] And I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them; [verse 54] that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them. [verse 55] And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate. [verse 56] For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride, [verse 57] before thy wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, that do despite unto thee round about. [verse 58] Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith Jehovah. [verse 59] For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant. [verse 6] And when I passed by thee, and saw thee weltering in thy blood, I said unto thee, [Though thou art] in thy blood, live; yea, I said unto thee, [Though thou art] in thy blood, live. [verse 60] Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. [verse 61] Then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder [sisters] and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant. [verse 62] And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah; [verse 63] that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 7] I caused thee to multiply as that which groweth in the field, and thou didst increase and wax great, and thou attainedst to excellent ornament; thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair was grown; yet thou wast naked and bare. [verse 8] Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord Jehovah, and thou becamest mine. [verse 9] Then washed I thee with water; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil."
1887,Ezekiel 17:1-24,"[Ezekiel] [ch 17] [verse 1] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 10] Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the beds where it grew. [verse 11] Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 12] Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and brought them to him to Babylon: [verse 13] and he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him; he also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land; [verse 14] that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand. [verse 15] But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? shall he break the covenant, and yet escape? [verse 16] As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die. [verse 17] Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many persons. [verse 18] For he hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet hath done all these things; he shall not escape. [verse 19] Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, I will even bring it upon his own head. [verse 2] Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel; [verse 20] And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me. [verse 21] And all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it. [verse 22] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it upon a high and lofty mountain: [verse 23] in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing; in the shade of the branches thereof shall they dwell. [verse 24] And all the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish; I, Jehovah, have spoken and have done it. [verse 3] and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came unto Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar: [verse 4] he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs thereof, and carried it unto a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants. [verse 5] He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters; he set it as a willow-tree. [verse 6] And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs. [verse 7] There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it. [verse 8] It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine. [verse 9] Say thou, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it may wither; that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? and not by a strong arm or much people can it be raised from the roots thereof."
1888,Ezekiel 18:1-32,"[Ezekiel] [ch 18] [verse 1] The word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying, [verse 10] If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth any one of these things, [verse 11] and that doeth not any of those [duties], but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbor's wife, [verse 12] hath wronged the poor and needy, hath taken by robbery, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination, [verse 13] hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase; shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him. [verse 14] Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins, which he hath done, and feareth, and doeth not such like; [verse 15] that hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbor's wife, [verse 16] neither hath wronged any, hath not taken aught to pledge, neither hath taken by robbery, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; [verse 17] that hath withdrawn his hand from the poor, that hath not received interest nor increase, hath executed mine ordinances, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live. [verse 18] As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity. [verse 19] Yet say ye, Wherefore doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? when the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live. [verse 2] What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? [verse 20] The soul that sinneth, it shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. [verse 21] But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. [verse 22] None of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live. [verse 23] Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? saith the Lord Jehovah; and not rather that he should return from his way, and live? [verse 24] But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he hath done shall be remembered: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die. [verse 25] Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal? [verse 26] When the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth therein; in his iniquity that he hath done shall he die. [verse 27] Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. [verse 28] Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die. [verse 29] Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal? [verse 3] As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, ye shall not have [occasion] any more to use this proverb in Israel. [verse 30] Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord Jehovah. Return ye, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. [verse 31] Cast away from you all your transgressions, wherein ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? [verse 32] For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord Jehovah: wherefore turn yourselves, and live. [verse 4] Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die. [verse 5] But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, [verse 6] and hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbor's wife, neither hath come near to a woman in her impurity, [verse 7] and hath not wronged any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath taken nought by robbery, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; [verse 8] he that hath not given forth upon interest, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true justice between man and man, [verse 9] hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept mine ordinances, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord Jehovah."
1889,Ezekiel 19:1-14,"[Ezekiel] [ch 19] [verse 1] Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, [verse 10] Thy mother was like a vine, in thy blood, planted by the waters: it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters. [verse 11] And it had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs, and they were seen in [ their height with the multitude of their branches. [verse 12] But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit: its strong rods were broken off and withered; the fire consumed them. [verse 13] And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land. [verse 14] And fire is gone out of the rods of its branches, it hath devoured its fruit, so that there is in it no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation. [verse 2] and say, What was thy mother? A lioness: she couched among lions, in the midst of the young lions she nourished her whelps. [verse 3] And she brought up one of her whelps: he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men. [verse 4] The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks unto the land of Egypt. [verse 5] Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion. [verse 6] And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men. [verse 7] And he knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, because of the noise of his roaring. [verse 8] Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit. [verse 9] And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into strongholds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel."
1890,Ezekiel 20:1-44,"[Ezekiel] [ch 20] [verse 1] And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth [month], the tenth [day] of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and sat before me. [verse 10] So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness. [verse 11] And I gave them my statutes, and showed them mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live in them. [verse 12] Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth them. [verse 13] But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they rejected mine ordinances, which if a man keep, he shall live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them. [verse 14] But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out. [verse 15] Moreover also I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands; [verse 16] because they rejected mine ordinances, and walked not in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols. [verse 17] Nevertheless mine eye spared them, and I destroyed them not, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness. [verse 18] And I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols. [verse 19] I am Jehovah your God: walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them; [verse 2] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 20] and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God. [verse 21] But the children rebelled against me; they walked not in my statutes, neither kept mine ordinances to do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them; they profaned my sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness. [verse 22] Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth. [verse 23] Moreover I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; [verse 24] because they had not executed mine ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols. [verse 25] Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live; [verse 26] and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through [the fire] all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah. [verse 27] Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me. [verse 28] For when I had brought them into the land, which I sware to give unto them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there also they made their sweet savor, and they poured out there their drink-offerings. [verse 29] Then I said unto them, What meaneth the high place whereunto ye go? So the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day. [verse 3] Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Is it to inquire of me that ye are come? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you. [verse 30] Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Do ye pollute yourselves after the manner of your fathers? and play ye the harlot after their abominations? [verse 31] and when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, do ye pollute yourselves with all your idols unto this day? and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you; [verse 32] and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, in that ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone. [verse 33] As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, will I be king over you: [verse 34] and I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out; [verse 35] and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face. [verse 36] Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 37] And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant; [verse 38] and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 39] As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Go ye, serve every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me; but my holy name shall ye no more profane with your gifts, and with your idols. [verse 4] Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers; [verse 40] For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them, serve me in the land: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first-fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things. [verse 41] As a sweet savor will I accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations. [verse 42] And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country which I sware to give unto your fathers. [verse 43] And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have polluted yourselves; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed. [verse 44] And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have dealt with you for my name's sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 5] and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when I chose Israel, and sware unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I sware unto them, saying, I am Jehovah your God; [verse 6] in that day I sware unto them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands. [verse 7] And I said unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God. [verse 8] But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me; they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. [verse 9] But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt."
1891,Ezekiel 21:1-32,"[Ezekiel] [ch 21] [verse 1] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 10] it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? the rod of my son, it contemneth every tree. [verse 11] And it is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer. [verse 12] Cry and wail, son of man; for it is upon my people, it is upon all the princes of Israel: they are delivered over to the sword with my people; smite therefore upon thy thigh. [verse 13] For there is a trial; and what if even the rod that contemneth shall be no more? saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 14] Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one that is deadly wounded, which entereth into their chambers. [verse 15] I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter. [verse 16] Gather thee together, go to the right, set thyself in array, go to the left, whithersoever thy face is set. [verse 17] I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest: I, Jehovah, have spoken it. [verse 18] The word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying, [verse 19] Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they twain shall come forth out of one land: and mark out a place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city. [verse 2] Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop [thy word] toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel; [verse 20] Thou shalt appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified. [verse 21] For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver. [verse 22] In his right hand was the divination [for] Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts. [verse 23] And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths unto them; but he bringeth iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken. [verse 24] Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand. [verse 25] And thou, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end, [verse 26] thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Remove the mitre, and take off the crown; this [shall be] no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high. [ [verse 27] I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: this also shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it [him] . [verse 28] And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and say thou, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning; [verse 29] while they see for thee false visions, while they divine lies unto thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are deadly wounded, whose day is come in the time of the iniquity of the end. [verse 3] and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked. [verse 30] Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy birth, will I judge thee. [verse 31] And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee; I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy. [verse 32] Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I, Jehovah, have spoken it. [verse 4] Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north: [verse 5] and all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more. [verse 6] Sigh therefore, thou son of man; with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes. [verse 7] And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt say, Because of the tidings, for it cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 8] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 9] Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah: Say, A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished;"
1892,Ezekiel 22:1-31,"[Ezekiel] [ch 22] [verse 1] Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 10] In thee have they uncovered their fathers' nakedness; in thee have they humbled her that was unclean in her impurity. [verse 11] And one hath committed abomination with his neighbor's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter. [verse 12] In thee have they taken bribes to shed blood; thou hast taken interest and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbors by oppression, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 13] Behold, therefore, I have smitten my hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee. [verse 14] Can thy heart endure, or can thy hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and will do it. [verse 15] And I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee through the countries; and I will consume thy filthiness out of thee. [verse 16] And thou shalt be profaned in thyself, in the sight of the nations; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah. [verse 17] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 18] Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross unto me: all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver. [verse 19] Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye are all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. [verse 2] And thou, son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? then cause her to know all her abominations. [verse 20] As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there, and melt you. [verse 21] Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof. [verse 22] As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have poured out my wrath upon you. [verse 23] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 24] Son of man, say unto her, Thou art a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation. [verse 25] There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey: they have devoured souls; they take treasure and precious things; they have made her widows many in the midst thereof. [verse 26] Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. [verse 27] Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, [and] to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain. [verse 28] And her prophets have daubed for them with untempered [mortar], seeing false visions, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, when Jehovah hath not spoken. [verse 29] The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery; yea, they have vexed the poor and needy, and have oppressed the sojourner wrongfully. [verse 3] And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A city that sheddeth blood in the midst of her, that her time may come, and that maketh idols against herself to defile her! [verse 30] And I sought for a man among them, that should build up the wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none. [verse 31] Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I brought upon their heads, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 4] Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed, and art defiled in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the nations, and a mocking to all the countries. [verse 5] Those that are near, and those that are far from thee, shall mock thee, thou infamous one [and] full of tumult. [verse 6] Behold, the princes of Israel, every one according to his power, have been in thee to shed blood. [verse 7] In thee have they set light by father and mother; in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the sojourner; in thee have they wronged the fatherless and the widow. [verse 8] Thou hast despised my holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths. [verse 9] Slanderous men have been in thee to shed blood; and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they have committed lewdness."
1893,Ezekiel 23:1-49,"[Ezekiel] [ch 23] [verse 1] The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying, [verse 10] These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters; and her they slew with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they executed judgments upon her. [verse 11] And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her whoredoms which were more than the whoredoms of her sister. [verse 12] She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and rulers, [her] neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men. [verse 13] And I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way. [verse 14] And she increased her whoredoms; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion, [verse 15] girded with girdles upon their loins, with flowing turbans upon their heads, all of them princes to look upon, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity. [verse 16] And as soon as she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea. [verse 17] And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them. [verse 18] So she uncovered her whoredoms, and uncovered her nakedness: then my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul was alienated from her sister. [verse 19] Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, remembering the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. [verse 2] Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother: [verse 20] And she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses. [verse 21] Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in the handling of thy bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of thy youth. [verse 22] Therefore, O Oholibah, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side: [verse 23] the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, [and] all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, princes and men of renown, all of them riding upon horses. [verse 24] And they shall come against thee with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples; they shall set themselves against thee with buckler and shield and helmet round about; and I will commit the judgment unto them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments. [verse 25] And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury; they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy residue shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire. [verse 26] They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels. [verse 27] Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom [brought] from the land of Egypt; so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more. [verse 28] For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy soul is alienated; [verse 29] and they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare; and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. [verse 3] and they played the harlot in Egypt; they played the harlot in their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there was handled the bosom of their virginity. [verse 30] These things shall be done unto thee, for that thou hast played the harlot after the nations, and because thou art polluted with their idols. [verse 31] Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thy hand. [verse 32] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup, which is deep and large; thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much. [verse 33] Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria. [verse 34] Thou shalt even drink it and drain it out, and thou shalt gnaw the sherds thereof, and shalt tear thy breasts; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 35] Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. [verse 36] Jehovah said moreover unto me: Son of man, wilt thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? then declare unto them their abominations. [verse 37] For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols have they committed adultery; and they have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass through [the fire] unto them to be devoured. [verse 38] Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. [verse 39] For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house. [verse 4] And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bare sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah. [verse 40] And furthermore ye have sent for men that come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent, and, lo, they came; for whom thou didst wash thyself, paint thine eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments, [ [verse 41] and sit upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou didst set mine incense and mine oil. [verse 42] And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets upon the hands of them [twain], and beautiful crowns upon their heads. [verse 43] Then said I of her that was old in adulteries, Now will they play the harlot with her, and she [with them] . [verse 44] And they went in unto her, as they go in unto a harlot: so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah, the lewd women. [verse 45] And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. [verse 46] For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed. [verse 47] And the company shall stone them with stones, and despatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire. [verse 48] Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness. [verse 49] And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah. [verse 5] And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians [her] neighbors, [verse 6] who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. [verse 7] And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomsoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself. [verse 8] Neither hath she left her whoredoms since [the days of] Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity; and they poured out their whoredom upon her. [ [verse 9] Wherefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted."
1894,Ezekiel 24:1-2,"[Ezekiel] [ch 24] [verse 1] Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 2] Son of man, write thee the name of the day, [even] of this selfsame day: the king of Babylon drew close unto Jerusalem this selfsame day."
1895,Ezekiel 24:3-14,"[Ezekiel] [ch 24] [verse 10] Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh, and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned. [verse 11] Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the rust of it may be consumed. [verse 12] She hath wearied [herself] with toil; yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her; her rust [goeth not forth] by fire. [verse 13] In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have cleansed thee and thou wast not cleansed, thou shalt not be cleansed from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my wrath toward thee to rest. [ [verse 14] I, Jehovah, have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 3] And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Set on the caldron, set it on, and also pour water into it: [verse 4] gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones. [verse 5] Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile [of wood] for the bones under [the caldron] ; make it boil well; yea, let the bones thereof be boiled in the midst of it. [verse 6] Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the caldron whose rust is therein, and whose rust is not gone out of it! take out of it piece after piece; No lot is fallen upon it. [verse 7] For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the bare rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust. [verse 8] That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered. [verse 9] Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great."
1896,Ezekiel 24:15-18,"[Ezekiel] [ch 24] [verse 15] Also the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 16] Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet thou shalt neither mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down. [verse 17] Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead; bind thy headtire upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men. [verse 18] So I spake unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded."
1897,Ezekiel 24:18,[Ezekiel] [ch 24] [verse 18] So I spake unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
1898,Ezekiel 24:19-27,"[Ezekiel] [ch 24] [verse 19] And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so? [verse 20] Then I said unto them, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 21] Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword. [verse 22] And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men. [verse 23] And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another. [verse 24] Thus shall Ezekiel be unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do: when this cometh, then shall ye know that I am the Lord Jehovah. [verse 25] And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart, their sons and their daughters, [verse 26] that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears? [verse 27] In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: so shalt thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah."
1899,Ezekiel 25:1-32:32,"[Ezekiel] [ch 25] [verse 1] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 10] unto the children of the east, [to go] against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations. [verse 11] and I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 12] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; [verse 13] therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; even unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword. [verse 14] And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 15] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity; [verse 16] therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. [verse 17] And I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them. [verse 2] Son of man, set thy face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them: [verse 3] and say unto the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity: [verse 4] therefore, behold, I will deliver thee to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk. [verse 5] And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching-place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 6] For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast clapped thy hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the despite of thy soul against the land of Israel; [verse 7] therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee off from the peoples, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah. [verse 8] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the nations; [verse 9] therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim, [ch 26] [verse 1] And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first [day] of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 10] By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach. [verse 11] With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people with the sword; and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground. [verse 12] And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise; and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses; and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters. [verse 13] And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard. [verse 14] And I will make thee a bare rock; thou shalt be a place for the spreading of nets; thou shalt be built no more: for I Jehovah have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 15] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee? [verse 16] Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble every moment, and be astonished at thee. [verse 17] And they shall take up a lamentation over thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited by seafaring men, the renowned city, that was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, that caused their terror to be on all that dwelt there! [verse 18] Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be dismayed at thy departure. [verse 19] For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and the great waters shall cover thee; [verse 2] Son of man, because that Tyre hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken [that was] the gate of the peoples; she is turned unto me; I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste: [verse 20] then will I bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make thee to dwell in the nether parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I will set glory in the land of the living. [verse 21] I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt no more have any being; though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 3] therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth its waves to come up. [verse 4] And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock. [verse 5] She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah; and she shall become a spoil to the nations. [verse 6] And her daughters that are in the field shall be slain with the sword: and they shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 7] For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring upon Tyre Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company, and much people. [verse 8] He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field; and he shall make forts against thee, and cast up a mound against thee, and raise up the buckler against thee. [verse 9] And he shall set his battering engines against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers. [ch 27] [verse 1] The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying, [verse 10] Persia and Lud and Put were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness. [verse 11] The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and valorous men were in thy towers; they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have perfected thy beauty. [verse 12] Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded for thy wares. [verse 13] Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy traffickers; they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for thy merchandise. [verse 14] They of the house of Togarmah traded for thy wares with horses and war-horses and mules. [verse 15] The men of Dedan were thy traffickers; many isles were the mart of thy hand: they brought thee in exchange horns of ivory and ebony. [verse 16] Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of thy handiworks: they traded for thy wares with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies. [verse 17] Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy traffickers: they traded for thy merchandise wheat of Minnith, and pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm. [verse 18] Damascus was thy merchant for the multitude of thy handiworks, by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches, with the wine of Helbon, and white wool. [verse 19] Vedan and Javan traded with yarn for thy wares: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were among thy merchandise. [verse 2] And thou, son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre; [verse 20] Dedan was thy trafficker in precious cloths for riding. [verse 21] Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were the merchants of thy hand; in lambs, and rams, and goats, in these were they thy merchants. [verse 22] The traffickers of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy traffickers; they traded for thy wares with the chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold. [verse 23] Haran and Canneh and Eden, the traffickers of Sheba, Asshur [and] Chilmad, were thy traffickers. [verse 24] These were thy traffickers in choice wares, in wrappings of blue and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, among thy merchandise. [verse 25] The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans for thy merchandise: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the heart of the seas. [verse 26] Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas. [verse 27] Thy riches, and thy wares, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the dealers in thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, with all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy ruin. [verse 28] At the sound of the cry of thy pilots the suburbs shall shake. [verse 29] And all that handled the oar, the mariners, [and] all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships; they shall stand upon the land, [verse 3] and say unto Tyre, O thou that dwellest at the entry of the sea, that art the merchant of the peoples unto many isles, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou, O Tyre, hast said, I am perfect in beauty. [verse 30] and shall cause their voice to be heard over thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes: [verse 31] and they shall make themselves bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning. [verse 32] And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, [saying], Who is there like Tyre, like her that is brought to silence in the midst of the sea? [verse 33] When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many peoples; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise. [verse 34] In the time that thou wast broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy merchandise and all thy company did fall in the midst of thee. [verse 35] All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee, and their kings are horribly afraid; they are troubled in their countenance. [verse 36] The merchants among the peoples hiss at thee; thou art become a terror, and thou shalt nevermore have any being. [verse 4] Thy borders are in the heart of the seas; thy builders have perfected thy beauty. [verse 5] They have made all thy planks of fir-trees from Senir; they have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for thee. [verse 6] Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; they have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood, from the isles of Kittim. [verse 7] Of fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thine awning. [verse 8] The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were thy rowers: thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee, they were thy pilots. [verse 9] The old men of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to deal in thy merchandise. [ch 28] [verse 1] The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying, [verse 10] Thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 11] Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 12] Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. [verse 13] Thou wast in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was in thee; in the day that thou wast created they were prepared. [verse 14] Thou wast the anointed cherub that covereth: and I set thee, [so that] thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. [verse 15] Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till unrighteousness was found in thee. [verse 16] By the abundance of thy traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore have I cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God; and I have destroyed thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. [verse 17] Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I have cast thee to the ground; I have laid thee before kings, that they may behold thee. [verse 18] By the multitude of thine iniquities, in the unrighteousness of thy traffic, thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries; therefore have I brought forth a fire from the midst of thee; it hath devoured thee, and I have turned thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. [verse 19] All they that know thee among the peoples shall be astonished at thee: thou art become a terror, and thou shalt nevermore have any being. [verse 2] Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a god, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art man, and not God, though thou didst set thy heart as the heart of God;-- [verse 20] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 21] Son of man, set thy face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it, [verse 22] and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her. [verse 23] For I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her, with the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. [ [verse 24] And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor a hurting thorn of any that are round about them, that did despite unto them; and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah. [verse 25] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob. [verse 26] And they shall dwell securely therein; yea, they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and shall dwell securely, when I have executed judgments upon all those that do them despite round about them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah their God. [verse 3] behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that is hidden from thee; [verse 4] by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures; [verse 5] by thy great wisdom [and] by thy traffic hast thou increased thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches;-- [verse 6] therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast set thy heart as the heart of God, [verse 7] therefore, behold, I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness. [verse 8] They shall bring thee down to the pit; and thou shalt die the death of them that are slain, in the heart of the seas. [verse 9] Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou art man, and not God, in the hand of him that woundeth thee. [ch 29] [verse 1] In the tenth year, in the tenth [month], in the twelfth [day] of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 10] therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even unto the border of Ethiopia. [verse 11] No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years. [verse 12] And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. [verse 13] For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered; [verse 14] and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth; and they shall be there a base kingdom. [verse 15] It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations. [verse 16] And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn to look after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah. [verse 17] And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first [month], in the first [day] of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 18] Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it. [verse 19] Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army. [verse 2] Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt; [verse 20] I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 21] In that day will I cause a horn to bud forth unto the house of Israel, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 3] speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself. [verse 4] And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales; and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, with all the fish of thy rivers which stick unto thy scales. [verse 5] And I will cast thee forth into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open field; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered; I have given thee for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the heavens. [verse 6] And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel. [verse 7] When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and didst rend all their shoulders; and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand. [verse 8] Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast. [verse 9] And the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. Because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it; [ch 30] [verse 1] The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying, [verse 10] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon. [verse 11] He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain. [verse 12] And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I, Jehovah, have spoken it. [verse 13] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt. [verse 14] And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments upon No. [verse 15] And I will pour my wrath upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No. [verse 16] And I will set a fire in Egypt: Sin shall be in great anguish, and No shall be broken up; and Memphis [shall have] adversaries in the day-time. [verse 17] The young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword; and these [cities] shall go into captivity. [verse 18] At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity. [verse 19] Thus will I execute judgments upon Egypt; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 2] Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Wail ye, Alas for the day! [verse 20] And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first [month], in the seventh [day] of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 21] Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been bound up, to apply [healing] medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword. [verse 22] Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong [arm], and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand. [verse 23] And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. [verse 24] And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man. [verse 25] And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt. [verse 26] And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 3] For the day is near, even the day of Jehovah is near; it shall be a day of clouds, a time of the nations. [verse 4] And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down. [verse 5] Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword. [verse 6] Thus saith Jehovah: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 7] And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted. [verse 8] And they shall know at I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed. [verse 9] In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh. [ch 31] [verse 1] And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third [month], in the first [day] of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 10] Therefore thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thou art exalted in stature, and he hath set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; [ [verse 11] I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with him; I have driven him out for his wickedness. [verse 12] And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him. [verse 13] Upon his ruin all the birds of the heavens shall dwell, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches; [verse 14] to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top among the thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height, [even] all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit. [verse 15] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the rivers thereof; and the great waters were stayed; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him. [verse 16] I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with them that descend into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the nether parts of the earth. [verse 17] They also went down into Sheol with him unto them that are slain by the sword; yea, they that were his arm, [that] dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations. [verse 18] To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 2] Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude: Whom art thou like in thy greatness? [verse 3] Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs. [verse 4] The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow: the rivers thereof ran round about its plantation; and it sent out its channels unto all the trees of the field. [verse 5] Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long by reason of many waters, when it shot [them] forth. [verse 6] All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; and under its branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young; and under its shadow dwelt all great nations. [verse 7] Thus was it fair in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its root was by many waters. [verse 8] The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir-trees were not like its boughs, and the plane-trees were not as its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God like unto it in its beauty. [verse 9] I made it fair by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it. [ch 32] [verse 1] And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first [day] of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 10] Yea, I will make many peoples amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall. [verse 11] For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee. [verse 12] By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall; the terrible of the nations are they all: and they shall bring to nought the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed. [verse 13] I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside many waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them. [verse 14] Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 15] When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am Jehovah. [verse 16] This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 17] It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth [day] of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 18] Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. [verse 19] Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised. [verse 2] Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou wast likened unto a young lion of the nations: yet art thou as a monster in the seas; and thou didst break forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers. [verse 20] They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword; draw her away and all her multitudes. [verse 21] The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword. [verse 22] Asshur is there and all her company; her graves are round about her; all of them slain, fallen by the sword; [verse 23] whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living. [verse 24] There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit. [verse 25] They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her graves are round about her; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that are slain. [verse 26] There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude; their graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living. [verse 27] And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, that are gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are upon their bones; for [they were] the terror of the mighty in the land of the living. [verse 28] But thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain by the sword. [verse 29] There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, who in their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit. [ [verse 3] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will spread out my net upon thee with a company of many peoples; and they shall bring thee up in my net. [verse 30] There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who are gone down with the slain; in the terror which they caused by their might they are put to shame; and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit. [verse 31] Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 32] For I have put his terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 4] And I will leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the birds of the heavens to settle upon thee, and I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with thee. [verse 5] And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height. [verse 6] I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the watercourses shall be full of thee. [verse 7] And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heavens, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light. [verse 8] All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 9] I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known."
1900,Ezekiel 33:1-20,"[Ezekiel] [ch 33] [verse 1] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 10] And thou, son of man, say unto the house of Israel: Thus ye speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them; how then can we live? [verse 11] Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? [verse 12] And thou, son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth. [verse 13] When I say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in his iniquity that he hath committed, therein shall he die. [verse 14] Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; [verse 15] if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. [verse 16] None of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live. [verse 17] Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal. [verse 18] When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die therein. [verse 19] And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby. [verse 2] Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman; [verse 20] Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways. [verse 3] if, when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; [verse 4] then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. [verse 5] He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him; whereas if he had taken warning, he would have delivered his soul. [verse 6] But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned, and the sword come, and take any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand. [verse 7] So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. [verse 8] When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die, and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand. [verse 9] Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he turn not from his way; he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul."
1901,Ezekiel 33:21,"[Ezekiel] [ch 33] [verse 21] And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten."
1902,Ezekiel 33:22,"[Ezekiel] [ch 33] [verse 22] Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and he had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb."
1903,Ezekiel 34:1-31,"[Ezekiel] [ch 34] [verse 1] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 10] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them. [verse 11] For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out. [verse 12] As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep; and I will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. [verse 13] And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country. [verse 14] I will feed them with good pasture; and upon the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie down in a good fold; and on fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel. [verse 15] I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 16] I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed them in justice. [verse 17] And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the he-goats. [verse 18] Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have fed upon the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture? and to have drunk of the clear waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet? [verse 19] And as for my sheep, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet. [verse 2] Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, even to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe unto the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the sheep? [verse 20] Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto them: Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. [verse 21] Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad; [verse 22] therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep. [verse 23] And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. [verse 24] And I, Jehovah, will be their God, and my servant David prince among them; I, Jehovah, have spoken it. [verse 25] And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. [verse 26] And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there shall be showers of blessing. [verse 27] And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hand of those that made bondmen of them. [verse 28] And they shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall the beasts of the earth devour them; but they shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid. [verse 29] And I will raise up unto them a plantation for renown, and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither bear the shame of the nations any more. [verse 3] Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill the fatlings; but ye feed not the sheep. [verse 30] And they shall know that I, Jehovah, their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 31] And ye my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 4] The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought back that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with rigor have ye ruled over them. [verse 5] And they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered. [verse 6] My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my sheep were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and there was none that did search or seek [after them] . [verse 7] Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah: [verse 8] As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely forasmuch as my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my sheep; [verse 9] therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:"
1904,Ezekiel 35:1-15,"[Ezekiel] [ch 35] [verse 1] Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 10] Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas Jehovah was there: [verse 11] therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast showed out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I shall judge thee. [verse 12] And thou shalt know that I, Jehovah, have heard all thy revilings which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour. [verse 13] And ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard it. [verse 14] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate. [verse 15] As thou didst rejoice over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 2] Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, [verse 3] and say unto it, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee a desolation and an astonishment. [verse 4] I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah. [verse 5] Because thou hast had a perpetual enmity, and hast given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end; [verse 6] therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: since thou hast not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee. [verse 7] Thus will I make mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation; and I will cut off from it him that passeth through and him that returneth. [verse 8] And I will fill its mountains with its slain: in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy watercourses shall they fall that are slain with the sword. [verse 9] I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah."
1905,Ezekiel 36:1-38,"[Ezekiel] [ch 36] [verse 1] And thou, son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah. [verse 10] and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded; [verse 11] and I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited after your former estate, and will do better [unto you] than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 12] Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children. [verse 13] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because they say unto you, Thou [land] art a devourer of men, and hast been a bereaver of thy nation; [verse 14] therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nation any more, saith the Lord Jehovah; [verse 15] neither will I let thee hear any more the shame of the nations, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to stumble any more, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 16] Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 17] Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity. [verse 18] Wherefore I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols; [verse 19] and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them. [verse 2] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha! and, The ancient high places are ours in possession; [verse 20] And when they came unto the nations, whither they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and are gone forth out of his land. [verse 21] But I had regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, whither they went. [verse 22] Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I do not [this] for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, whither ye went. [verse 23] And I will sanctify my great name, which hath been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, saith the Lord Jehovah, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. [verse 24] For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. [verse 25] And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. [verse 26] A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. [verse 27] And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep mine ordinances, and do them. [verse 28] And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. [verse 29] And I will save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you. [verse 3] therefore prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because, even because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the nations, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and the evil report of the people; [verse 30] And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations. [verse 31] Then shall ye remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations. [verse 32] Not for your sake do I [this], saith the Lord Jehovah, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel. [verse 33] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded. [verse 34] And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by. [verse 35] And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited. [verse 36] Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I, Jehovah, have builded the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate: I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and I will do it. [verse 37] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: For this, moreover, will I be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock. [verse 38] As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 4] therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are round about; [verse 5] therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, that have appointed my land unto themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite of soul, to cast it out for a prey. [verse 6] Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because ye have borne the shame of the nations: [verse 7] therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I have sworn, [saying], Surely the nations that are round about you, they shall bear their shame. [verse 8] But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they are at hand to come. [verse 9] For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown;"
1906,Ezekiel 37:1-10,"[Ezekiel] [ch 37] [verse 1] The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones. [verse 10] So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. [verse 2] And he caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. [verse 3] And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest. [verse 4] Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah. [verse 5] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live. [verse 6] And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 7] So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone. [verse 8] And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them. [verse 9] Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live."
1907,Ezekiel 37:1,"[Ezekiel] [ch 37] [verse 1] The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones."
1908,Ezekiel 37:7-8,"[Ezekiel] [ch 37] [verse 7] So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone. [verse 8] And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them."
1909,Ezekiel 37:9-10,"[Ezekiel] [ch 37] [verse 10] So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. [verse 9] Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live."
1910,Ezekiel 37:11-14,"[Ezekiel] [ch 37] [verse 11] Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off. [verse 12] Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. [verse 13] And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people. [verse 14] And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, saith Jehovah."
1911,Ezekiel 37:15-28,"[Ezekiel] [ch 37] [verse 15] The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying, [verse 16] And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and [for] all the house of Israel his companions: [verse 17] and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand. [verse 18] And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these? [verse 19] say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, [even] with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand. [verse 20] And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes. [verse 21] And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land: [verse 22] and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all; [verse 23] neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God. [verse 24] And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in mine ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them. [verse 25] And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children's children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever. [verse 26] Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. [verse 27] My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. [verse 28] And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore."
1912,Ezekiel 38:1-39:29,"[Ezekiel] [ch 38] [verse 1] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 10] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: It shall come to pass in that day, that things shall come into thy mind, and thou shalt devise an evil device: [verse 11] and thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates; [verse 12] to take the spoil and to take the prey; to turn thy hand against the waste places that are [now] inhabited, and against the people that are gathered out of the nations, that have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the middle of the earth. [verse 13] Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take the spoil? hast thou assembled thy company to take the prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take great spoil? [verse 14] Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In that day when my people Israel dwelleth securely, shalt thou not know it? [verse 15] And thou shalt come from thy place out of the uttermost parts of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army; [verse 16] and thou shalt come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes. [verse 17] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Art thou he of whom I spake in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, that prophesied in those days for [many] years that I would bring thee against them? [verse 18] And it shall come to pass in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils. [verse 19] For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel; [verse 2] Son of man, set thy face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him, [verse 20] so that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. [verse 21] And I will call for a sword against him unto all my mountains, saith the Lord Jehovah: every man's sword shall be against his brother. [verse 22] And with pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him; and I will rain upon him, and upon his hordes, and upon the many peoples that are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. [verse 23] And I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 3] and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal: [verse 4] and I will turn thee about, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords; [verse 5] Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet; [verse 6] Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north, and all his hordes; even many peoples with thee. [verse 7] Be thou prepared, yea, prepare thyself, thou, and all thy companies that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them. [verse 8] After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste; but it is brought forth out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely, all of them. [verse 9] And thou shalt ascend, thou shalt come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy hordes, and many peoples with thee. [ch 39] [verse 1] And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal: [verse 10] so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall make fires of the weapons; and they shall plunder those that plundered them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 11] And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of them that pass through on the east of the sea; and it shall stop them that pass through: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and they shall call it The valley of Hamon-gog. [verse 12] And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land. [verse 13] Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 14] And they shall set apart men of continual employment, that shall pass through the land, and, with them that pass through, those that bury them that remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search. [verse 15] And they that pass through the land shall pass through; and when any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog. [verse 16] And Hamonah shall also be the name of a city. Thus shall they cleanse the land. [verse 17] And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Speak unto the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood. [verse 18] Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan. [verse 19] And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you. [verse 2] and I will turn thee about, and will lead thee on, and will cause thee to come up from the uttermost parts of the north; and I will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel; [verse 20] And ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 21] And I will set my glory among the nations; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them. [verse 22] So the house of Israel shall know that I am Jehovah their God, from that day and forward. [verse 23] And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them: so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword. [verse 24] According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I unto them; and I hid my face from them. [verse 25] Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name. [verse 26] And they shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell securely in their land, and none shall make them afraid; [verse 27] when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations. [verse 28] And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them unto their own land; and I will leave none of them any more there; [verse 29] neither will I hide my face any more from them; for I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 3] and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand. [verse 4] Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy hordes, and the peoples that are with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured. [verse 5] Thou shalt fall upon the open field; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 6] And I will send a fire on Magog, and on them that dwell securely in the isles; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. [verse 7] And my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel; neither will I suffer my holy name to be profaned any more: and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, the Holy One in Israel. [verse 8] Behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah; this is the day whereof I have spoken. [verse 9] And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall make fires of them seven years;"
1913,Ezekiel 40:1-48:35,"[Ezekiel] [ch 40] [verse 1] In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither. [verse 10] And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side. [verse 11] And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits; [verse 12] and a border before the lodges, one cubit [on this side], and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. [verse 13] And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits; door against door. [verse 14] He made also posts, threescore cubits; and the court [reached] unto the posts, round about the gate. [verse 15] And [from] the forefront of the gate at the entrance unto the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits. [verse 16] And there were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and windows were round about inward; and upon [each] post were palm-trees. [verse 17] Then brought he me into the outer court; and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement. [verse 18] And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable unto the length of the gates, even the lower pavement. [verse 19] Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits, [both] on the east and on the north. [verse 2] In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south. [verse 20] And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof. [verse 21] And the lodges thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. [verse 22] And the windows thereof, and the arches thereof, and the palm-trees thereof, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them. [verse 23] And there was a gate to the inner court over against the [other] gate, [both] on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits. [verse 24] And he led me toward the south; and, behold, a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures. [verse 25] And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. [verse 26] And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof. [verse 27] And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits. [verse 28] Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures; [verse 29] and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. [verse 3] And he brought me thither; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. [verse 30] And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad. [verse 31] And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof: and the ascent to it had eight steps. [verse 32] And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures; [verse 33] and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. [verse 34] And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps. [verse 35] And he brought me to the north gate: and he measured [it] according to these measures; [verse 36] the lodges thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof: and there were windows therein round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. [verse 37] And the posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps. [verse 38] And a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering. [verse 39] And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering. [verse 4] And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them unto thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel. [verse 40] And on the [one] side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables. [ [verse 41] Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew [the sacrifices] . [verse 42] And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice. [verse 43] And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation. [verse 44] And without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north. [verse 45] And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house; [verse 46] and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Jehovah to minister unto him. [verse 47] And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house. [verse 48] Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. [verse 49] The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side. [verse 5] And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed. [verse 6] Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad. [verse 7] And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and [the space] between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed. [verse 8] He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed. [verse 9] Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house. [ch 41] [verse 1] And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle. [verse 10] And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side. [verse 11] And the doors of the side-chambers were toward [the place] that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about. [verse 12] And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits. [verse 13] So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long; [verse 14] also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits. [verse 15] And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back thereof, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court; [verse 16] the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the threshold, ceiled with wood round about, and [from] the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered), [verse 17] to [the space] above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure. [verse 18] And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees; and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces; [verse 19] so that there was the face of a man toward the palm-tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the other side. [thus was it] made through all the house round about: [verse 2] And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits. [verse 20] from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm-trees made; thus was the wall of the temple. [verse 21] As for the temple, the door-posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance [thereof] was as the appearance [of the temple] . [verse 22] The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before Jehovah. [verse 23] And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. [verse 24] And the doors had two leaves [apiece], two turning leaves: two [leaves] for the one door, and two leaves for the other. [verse 25] And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there was a threshold of wood upon the face of the porch without. [verse 26] And there were closed windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side-chambers of the house, and the thresholds. [verse 3] Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits. [verse 4] And he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place. [verse 5] Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side. [verse 6] And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold [therein], and not have hold in the wall of the house. [verse 7] And the side-chambers were broader as they encompassed [the house] higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house [continued] upward; and so one went up [from] the lowest [chamber] to the highest by the middle [chamber] . [verse 8] I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits. [verse 9] The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to the house. [ch 42] [verse 1] Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north. [verse 10] In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were chambers. [verse 11] And the way before them was like the appearance of [the way of] the chambers which were toward the north; according to their length so was their breadth: and all their egresses were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. [verse 12] And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them. [verse 13] Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests that are near unto Jehovah shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy. [verse 14] When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertaineth to the people. [verse 15] Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about. [verse 16] He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. [verse 17] He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about. [verse 18] He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. [verse 19] He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. [verse 2] Before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits. [verse 20] He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common. [ [verse 3] Over against the twenty [cubits] which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story. [verse 4] And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits' breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north. [verse 5] Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building. [verse 6] For they were in three stories, and they had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore [the uppermost] was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground. [verse 7] And the wall that was without by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court before the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits. [verse 8] For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were a hundred cubits. [verse 9] And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court. [ch 43] [verse 1] Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east. [verse 10] Thou, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern. [verse 11] And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known unto them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the egresses thereof, and the entrances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof; and write it in their sight; that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them. [verse 12] This is the law of the house: upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house. [verse 13] And these are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about a span; and this shall be the base of the altar. [verse 14] And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit. [verse 15] And the upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns. [verse 16] And the altar hearth shall be twelve [cubits] long by twelve broad, square in the four sides thereof. [verse 17] And the ledge shall be fourteen [cubits] long by fourteen broad in the four sides thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit round about; and the steps thereof shall look toward the east. [verse 18] And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon. [verse 19] Thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who are near unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord Jehovah, a young bullock for a sin-offering. [verse 2] And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory. [verse 20] And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse it and make atonement for it. [verse 21] Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. [verse 22] And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock. [verse 23] When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. [verse 24] And thou shalt bring them near before Jehovah, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah. [verse 25] Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin-offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish. [verse 26] Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it. [verse 27] And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 3] And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face. [verse 4] And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. [verse 5] And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house. [verse 6] And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man stood by me. [verse 7] And he said unto me, Son of man, [this is] the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, and by the dead bodies of their kings [in] their high places; [verse 8] in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door-post beside my door-post, and there was [but] the wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger. [verse 9] Now let them put away their whoredom, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me; and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever. [ch 44] [verse 1] Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looketh toward the east; and it was shut. [verse 10] But the Levites that went far from me, when Israel went astray, that went astray from me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity. [verse 11] Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they shall slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them. [verse 12] Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and became a stumblingblock of iniquity unto the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Jehovah, and they shall bear their iniquity. [verse 13] And they shall not come near unto me, to execute the office of priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, unto the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed. [verse 14] Yet will I make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein. [verse 15] But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me; and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Jehovah: [verse 16] they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge. [verse 17] And it shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. [verse 18] They shall have linen tires upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with [anything that causeth] sweat. [verse 19] And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, that they sanctify not the people with their garments. [verse 2] And Jehovah said unto me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut. [verse 20] Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only cut off the hair of their heads. [verse 21] Neither shall any of the priests drink wine, when they enter into the inner court. [verse 22] Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest. [verse 23] And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. [verse 24] And in a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to mine ordinances shall they judge it: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts; and they shall hallow my sabbaths. [verse 25] And they shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves. [verse 26] And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days. [verse 27] And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 28] And they shall have an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and ye shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession. [verse 29] They shall eat the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs. [verse 3] As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Jehovah; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same. [verse 30] And the first of all the first-fruits of every thing, and every oblation of everything, of all your oblations, shall be for the priest: ye shall also give unto the priests the first of your [ dough, to cause a blessing to rest on thy house. [verse 31] The priests shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself, or is torn, whether it be bird or beast. [verse 4] Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah: and I fell upon my face. [verse 5] And Jehovah said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every egress of the sanctuary. [verse 6] And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations, [verse 7] in that ye have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, [to add] unto all your abominations. [verse 8] And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things; but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves. [verse 9] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners that are among the children of Israel. [ch 45] [verse 1] Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto Jehovah, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand [reeds], and the breadth shall be ten thousand: it shall be holy in all the border thereof round about. [verse 10] Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. [verse 11] The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer. [verse 12] And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh. [verse 13] This is the oblation that ye shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat; and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of barley; [verse 14] and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, [which is] ten baths, even a homer; (for ten baths are a homer;) [verse 15] and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel;--for a meal-offering, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 16] All the people of the land shall give unto this oblation for the prince in Israel. [verse 17] And it shall be the prince's part to give the burnt-offerings, and the meal-offerings, and the drink-offerings, in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin-offering, and the meal-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel. [verse 18] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the first [month], in the first [day] of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish; and thou shalt cleanse the sanctuary. [verse 19] And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. [verse 2] Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred [in length] by five hundred [in breadth], square round about; and fifty cubits for the suburbs thereof round about. [verse 20] And so thou shalt do on the seventh [day] of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye make atonement for the house. [verse 21] In the first [month], in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. [verse 22] And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering. [verse 23] And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt-offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a he-goat daily for a sin-offering. [verse 24] And he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah. [verse 25] In the seventh [month], in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, shall he do the like the seven days; according to the sin-offering, according to the burnt-offering, and according to the meal-offering, and according to the oil. [verse 3] And of this measure shalt thou measure a length of five and twenty thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy. [verse 4] It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, that come near to minister unto Jehovah; and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary. [verse 5] And five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall be unto the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession unto themselves, [for] twenty chambers. [verse 6] And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, side by side with the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel. [verse 7] And [whatsoever is] for the prince [shall be] on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy oblation and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward; and in length answerable unto one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border. [verse 8] In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes. [verse 9] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness; take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord Jehovah. [ch 46] [verse 1] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened. [verse 10] And the prince, when they go in, shall go in in the midst of them; and when they go forth, they shall go forth [together] . [verse 11] And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal-offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. [verse 12] And when the prince shall prepare a freewill-offering, a burnt-offering or peace-offerings as a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, one shall open for him the gate that looketh toward the east; and he shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, as he doth on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate. [verse 13] And thou shalt prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah daily: morning by morning shalt thou prepare it. [verse 14] And thou shalt prepare a meal-offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal-offering unto Jehovah continually by a perpetual ordinance. [verse 15] Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt-offering. [verse 16] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance. [verse 17] But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons. [verse 18] Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people be not scattered every man from his possession. [verse 19] Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward. [verse 2] And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. [verse 20] And he said unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, [and] where they shall bake the meal-offering; that they bring them not forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people. [verse 21] Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. [verse 22] In the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed, forty [cubits] long and thirty broad: these four in the corners were of one measure. [verse 23] And there was a wall round about in them, round about the four, and boiling-places were made under the walls round about. [verse 24] Then said he unto me, These are the boiling-houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people. [verse 3] And the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons. [verse 4] And the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer unto Jehovah shall be on the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish; [verse 5] and the meal-offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal-offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. [verse 6] And on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish: [verse 7] and he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah. [verse 8] And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof. [verse 9] But when the people of the land shall come before Jehovah in the appointed feasts, he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth straight before him. [ch 47] [verse 1] And he brought me back unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward; (for the forefront of the house was toward the east;) and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar. [verse 10] And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand by it: from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many. [verse 11] But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given up to salt. [verse 12] And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not whither, neither shall the fruit thereof fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for healing. [verse 13] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This shall be the border, whereby ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph [shall have two] portions. [verse 14] And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I sware to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance. [verse 15] And this shall be the border of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, unto the entrance of Zedad; [verse 16] Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran. [verse 17] And the border from the sea, shall be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side. [verse 18] And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the [north] border unto the east sea shall ye measure. This is the east side. [verse 19] And the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the brook [of Egypt], unto the great sea. This is the south side southward. [verse 2] Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way without unto the outer gate, by the way of [the gate] that looketh toward the east; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side. [verse 20] And the west side shall be the great sea, from the [south] border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side. [verse 21] So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel. [verse 22] And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you and to the strangers that sojourn among you, who shall beget children among you; and they shall be unto you as the home-born among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. [verse 23] And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 3] When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles. [verse 4] Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through [the waters], waters that were to the loins. [verse 5] Afterward he measured a thousand; [and it was] a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. [verse 6] And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen [this] ? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river. [verse 7] Now when I had returned, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. [verse 8] Then said he unto me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah; and they shall go toward the sea; into the sea [shall the waters go] which were made to issue forth; and the waters shall be healed. [verse 9] And it shall come to pass, that every living creature which swarmeth, in every place whither the rivers come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters are come thither, and [the waters of the sea] shall be healed, and everything shall live whithersoever the river cometh. [ch 48] [verse 1] Now these are the names of the tribes: From the north end, beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, northward beside Hamath, (and they shall have their sides east [and] west,) Dan, one [portion] . [verse 10] And for these, even for the priests, shall be the holy oblation: toward the north five and twenty thousand [in length], and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of Jehovah shall be in the midst thereof. [verse 11] [It shall be] for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, that have kept my charge, that went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray. [ [verse 12] And it shall be unto them an oblation from the oblation of the land, a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites. [verse 13] And answerable unto the border of the priests, the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand. [verse 14] And they shall sell none of it, nor exchange it, nor shall the first-fruits of the land be alienated; for it is holy unto Jehovah. [verse 15] And the five thousand that are left in the breadth, in front of the five and twenty thousand, shall be for common use, for the city, for dwelling and for suburbs; and the city shall be in the midst thereof. [verse 16] And these shall be the measures thereof: the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred. [verse 17] And the city shall have suburbs: toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty. [verse 18] And the residue in the length, answerable unto the holy oblation, shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward; and it shall be answerable unto the holy oblation; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that labor in the city. [verse 19] And they that labor in the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall till it. [verse 2] And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, Asher, one [portion] . [verse 20] All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation four-square, with the possession of the city. [verse 21] And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city; in front of the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward in front of the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, answerable unto the portions, it shall be for the prince: and the holy oblation and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof. [verse 22] Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, it shall be for the prince. [verse 23] And as for the rest of the tribes: from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin, one [portion] . [verse 24] And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, Simeon, one [portion] . [verse 25] And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, Issachar, one [portion] . [verse 26] And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, Zebulun, one [portion] . [verse 27] And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, Gad, one [portion] . [verse 28] And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook [of Egypt], unto the great sea. [verse 29] This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their several portions, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 3] And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, Naphtali, one [portion] . [verse 30] And these are the egresses of the city: On the north side four thousand and five hundred [reeds] by measure; [verse 31] and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel, three gates northward: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one. [verse 32] And at the east side four thousand and five hundred [reeds], and three gates: even the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one. [verse 33] And at the south side four thousand and five hundred [reeds] by measure, and three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one. [verse 34] At the west side four thousand and five hundred [reeds], with their three gates: the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher, one; the gate of Naphtali, one. [verse 35] It shall be eighteen thousand [reeds] round about: and the name of the city from that day shall be, Jehovah is there. [verse 4] And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, Manasseh, one [portion] . [verse 5] And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side, Ephraim, one [portion] . [verse 6] And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, Reuben, one [portion] . [verse 7] And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, Judah, one [portion] . [verse 8] And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the oblation which ye shall offer, five and twenty thousand [reeds] in breadth, and in length as one of the portions, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it. [verse 9] The oblation that ye shall offer unto Jehovah shall be five and twenty thousand [reeds] in length, and ten thousand in breadth."
1914,Ezekiel 40:1-2,"[Ezekiel] [ch 40] [verse 1] In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither. [verse 2] In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south."
1915,Ezekiel 40:3-4,"[Ezekiel] [ch 40] [verse 3] And he brought me thither; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. [verse 4] And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them unto thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel."
1916,Ezekiel 40:5-42:20,"[Ezekiel] [ch 40] [verse 10] And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side. [verse 11] And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits; [verse 12] and a border before the lodges, one cubit [on this side], and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. [verse 13] And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits; door against door. [verse 14] He made also posts, threescore cubits; and the court [reached] unto the posts, round about the gate. [verse 15] And [from] the forefront of the gate at the entrance unto the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits. [verse 16] And there were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and windows were round about inward; and upon [each] post were palm-trees. [verse 17] Then brought he me into the outer court; and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement. [verse 18] And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable unto the length of the gates, even the lower pavement. [verse 19] Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits, [both] on the east and on the north. [verse 20] And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof. [verse 21] And the lodges thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. [verse 22] And the windows thereof, and the arches thereof, and the palm-trees thereof, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them. [verse 23] And there was a gate to the inner court over against the [other] gate, [both] on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits. [verse 24] And he led me toward the south; and, behold, a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures. [verse 25] And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. [verse 26] And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof. [verse 27] And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits. [verse 28] Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures; [verse 29] and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. [verse 30] And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad. [verse 31] And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof: and the ascent to it had eight steps. [verse 32] And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures; [verse 33] and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. [verse 34] And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps. [verse 35] And he brought me to the north gate: and he measured [it] according to these measures; [verse 36] the lodges thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof: and there were windows therein round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. [verse 37] And the posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps. [verse 38] And a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering. [verse 39] And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering. [verse 40] And on the [one] side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables. [ [verse 41] Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew [the sacrifices] . [verse 42] And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice. [verse 43] And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation. [verse 44] And without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north. [verse 45] And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house; [verse 46] and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Jehovah to minister unto him. [verse 47] And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house. [verse 48] Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. [verse 49] The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side. [verse 5] And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed. [verse 6] Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad. [verse 7] And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and [the space] between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed. [verse 8] He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed. [verse 9] Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house. [ch 41] [verse 1] And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle. [verse 10] And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side. [verse 11] And the doors of the side-chambers were toward [the place] that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about. [verse 12] And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits. [verse 13] So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long; [verse 14] also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits. [verse 15] And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back thereof, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court; [verse 16] the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the threshold, ceiled with wood round about, and [from] the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered), [verse 17] to [the space] above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure. [verse 18] And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees; and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces; [verse 19] so that there was the face of a man toward the palm-tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the other side. [thus was it] made through all the house round about: [verse 2] And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits. [verse 20] from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm-trees made; thus was the wall of the temple. [verse 21] As for the temple, the door-posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance [thereof] was as the appearance [of the temple] . [verse 22] The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before Jehovah. [verse 23] And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. [verse 24] And the doors had two leaves [apiece], two turning leaves: two [leaves] for the one door, and two leaves for the other. [verse 25] And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there was a threshold of wood upon the face of the porch without. [verse 26] And there were closed windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side-chambers of the house, and the thresholds. [verse 3] Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits. [verse 4] And he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place. [verse 5] Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side. [verse 6] And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold [therein], and not have hold in the wall of the house. [verse 7] And the side-chambers were broader as they encompassed [the house] higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house [continued] upward; and so one went up [from] the lowest [chamber] to the highest by the middle [chamber] . [verse 8] I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits. [verse 9] The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to the house. [ch 42] [verse 1] Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north. [verse 10] In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were chambers. [verse 11] And the way before them was like the appearance of [the way of] the chambers which were toward the north; according to their length so was their breadth: and all their egresses were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. [verse 12] And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them. [verse 13] Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests that are near unto Jehovah shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy. [verse 14] When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertaineth to the people. [verse 15] Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about. [verse 16] He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. [verse 17] He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about. [verse 18] He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. [verse 19] He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. [verse 2] Before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits. [verse 20] He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common. [ [verse 3] Over against the twenty [cubits] which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story. [verse 4] And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits' breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north. [verse 5] Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building. [verse 6] For they were in three stories, and they had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore [the uppermost] was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground. [verse 7] And the wall that was without by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court before the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits. [verse 8] For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were a hundred cubits. [verse 9] And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court."
1917,Ezekiel 43:1-5,"[Ezekiel] [ch 43] [verse 1] Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east. [verse 2] And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory. [verse 3] And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face. [verse 4] And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. [verse 5] And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house."
1918,Ezekiel 43:6-7,"[Ezekiel] [ch 43] [verse 6] And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man stood by me. [verse 7] And he said unto me, Son of man, [this is] the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, and by the dead bodies of their kings [in] their high places;"
1919,Ezekiel 43:18-27,"[Ezekiel] [ch 43] [verse 18] And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon. [verse 19] Thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who are near unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord Jehovah, a young bullock for a sin-offering. [verse 20] And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse it and make atonement for it. [verse 21] Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. [verse 22] And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock. [verse 23] When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. [verse 24] And thou shalt bring them near before Jehovah, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah. [verse 25] Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin-offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish. [verse 26] Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it. [verse 27] And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord Jehovah."
1920,Ezekiel 44:1-31,"[Ezekiel] [ch 44] [verse 1] Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looketh toward the east; and it was shut. [verse 10] But the Levites that went far from me, when Israel went astray, that went astray from me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity. [verse 11] Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they shall slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them. [verse 12] Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and became a stumblingblock of iniquity unto the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Jehovah, and they shall bear their iniquity. [verse 13] And they shall not come near unto me, to execute the office of priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, unto the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed. [verse 14] Yet will I make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein. [verse 15] But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me; and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Jehovah: [verse 16] they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge. [verse 17] And it shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. [verse 18] They shall have linen tires upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with [anything that causeth] sweat. [verse 19] And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, that they sanctify not the people with their garments. [verse 2] And Jehovah said unto me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut. [verse 20] Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only cut off the hair of their heads. [verse 21] Neither shall any of the priests drink wine, when they enter into the inner court. [verse 22] Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest. [verse 23] And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. [verse 24] And in a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to mine ordinances shall they judge it: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts; and they shall hallow my sabbaths. [verse 25] And they shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves. [verse 26] And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days. [verse 27] And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 28] And they shall have an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and ye shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession. [verse 29] They shall eat the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs. [verse 3] As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Jehovah; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same. [verse 30] And the first of all the first-fruits of every thing, and every oblation of everything, of all your oblations, shall be for the priest: ye shall also give unto the priests the first of your [ dough, to cause a blessing to rest on thy house. [verse 31] The priests shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself, or is torn, whether it be bird or beast. [verse 4] Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah: and I fell upon my face. [verse 5] And Jehovah said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every egress of the sanctuary. [verse 6] And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations, [verse 7] in that ye have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, [to add] unto all your abominations. [verse 8] And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things; but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves. [verse 9] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners that are among the children of Israel."
1921,Ezekiel 45:1-48:35,"[Ezekiel] [ch 45] [verse 1] Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto Jehovah, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand [reeds], and the breadth shall be ten thousand: it shall be holy in all the border thereof round about. [verse 10] Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. [verse 11] The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer. [verse 12] And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh. [verse 13] This is the oblation that ye shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat; and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of barley; [verse 14] and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, [which is] ten baths, even a homer; (for ten baths are a homer;) [verse 15] and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel;--for a meal-offering, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 16] All the people of the land shall give unto this oblation for the prince in Israel. [verse 17] And it shall be the prince's part to give the burnt-offerings, and the meal-offerings, and the drink-offerings, in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin-offering, and the meal-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel. [verse 18] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the first [month], in the first [day] of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish; and thou shalt cleanse the sanctuary. [verse 19] And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. [verse 2] Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred [in length] by five hundred [in breadth], square round about; and fifty cubits for the suburbs thereof round about. [verse 20] And so thou shalt do on the seventh [day] of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye make atonement for the house. [verse 21] In the first [month], in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. [verse 22] And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering. [verse 23] And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt-offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a he-goat daily for a sin-offering. [verse 24] And he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah. [verse 25] In the seventh [month], in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, shall he do the like the seven days; according to the sin-offering, according to the burnt-offering, and according to the meal-offering, and according to the oil. [verse 3] And of this measure shalt thou measure a length of five and twenty thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy. [verse 4] It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, that come near to minister unto Jehovah; and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary. [verse 5] And five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall be unto the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession unto themselves, [for] twenty chambers. [verse 6] And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, side by side with the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel. [verse 7] And [whatsoever is] for the prince [shall be] on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy oblation and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward; and in length answerable unto one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border. [verse 8] In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes. [verse 9] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness; take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord Jehovah. [ch 46] [verse 1] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened. [verse 10] And the prince, when they go in, shall go in in the midst of them; and when they go forth, they shall go forth [together] . [verse 11] And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal-offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. [verse 12] And when the prince shall prepare a freewill-offering, a burnt-offering or peace-offerings as a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, one shall open for him the gate that looketh toward the east; and he shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, as he doth on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate. [verse 13] And thou shalt prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah daily: morning by morning shalt thou prepare it. [verse 14] And thou shalt prepare a meal-offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal-offering unto Jehovah continually by a perpetual ordinance. [verse 15] Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt-offering. [verse 16] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance. [verse 17] But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons. [verse 18] Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people be not scattered every man from his possession. [verse 19] Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward. [verse 2] And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. [verse 20] And he said unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, [and] where they shall bake the meal-offering; that they bring them not forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people. [verse 21] Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. [verse 22] In the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed, forty [cubits] long and thirty broad: these four in the corners were of one measure. [verse 23] And there was a wall round about in them, round about the four, and boiling-places were made under the walls round about. [verse 24] Then said he unto me, These are the boiling-houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people. [verse 3] And the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons. [verse 4] And the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer unto Jehovah shall be on the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish; [verse 5] and the meal-offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal-offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. [verse 6] And on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish: [verse 7] and he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah. [verse 8] And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof. [verse 9] But when the people of the land shall come before Jehovah in the appointed feasts, he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth straight before him. [ch 47] [verse 1] And he brought me back unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward; (for the forefront of the house was toward the east;) and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar. [verse 10] And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand by it: from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many. [verse 11] But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given up to salt. [verse 12] And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not whither, neither shall the fruit thereof fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for healing. [verse 13] Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This shall be the border, whereby ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph [shall have two] portions. [verse 14] And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I sware to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance. [verse 15] And this shall be the border of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, unto the entrance of Zedad; [verse 16] Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran. [verse 17] And the border from the sea, shall be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side. [verse 18] And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the [north] border unto the east sea shall ye measure. This is the east side. [verse 19] And the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the brook [of Egypt], unto the great sea. This is the south side southward. [verse 2] Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way without unto the outer gate, by the way of [the gate] that looketh toward the east; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side. [verse 20] And the west side shall be the great sea, from the [south] border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side. [verse 21] So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel. [verse 22] And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you and to the strangers that sojourn among you, who shall beget children among you; and they shall be unto you as the home-born among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. [verse 23] And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 3] When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles. [verse 4] Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through [the waters], waters that were to the loins. [verse 5] Afterward he measured a thousand; [and it was] a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. [verse 6] And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen [this] ? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river. [verse 7] Now when I had returned, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. [verse 8] Then said he unto me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah; and they shall go toward the sea; into the sea [shall the waters go] which were made to issue forth; and the waters shall be healed. [verse 9] And it shall come to pass, that every living creature which swarmeth, in every place whither the rivers come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters are come thither, and [the waters of the sea] shall be healed, and everything shall live whithersoever the river cometh. [ch 48] [verse 1] Now these are the names of the tribes: From the north end, beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, northward beside Hamath, (and they shall have their sides east [and] west,) Dan, one [portion] . [verse 10] And for these, even for the priests, shall be the holy oblation: toward the north five and twenty thousand [in length], and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of Jehovah shall be in the midst thereof. [verse 11] [It shall be] for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, that have kept my charge, that went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray. [ [verse 12] And it shall be unto them an oblation from the oblation of the land, a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites. [verse 13] And answerable unto the border of the priests, the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand. [verse 14] And they shall sell none of it, nor exchange it, nor shall the first-fruits of the land be alienated; for it is holy unto Jehovah. [verse 15] And the five thousand that are left in the breadth, in front of the five and twenty thousand, shall be for common use, for the city, for dwelling and for suburbs; and the city shall be in the midst thereof. [verse 16] And these shall be the measures thereof: the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred. [verse 17] And the city shall have suburbs: toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty. [verse 18] And the residue in the length, answerable unto the holy oblation, shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward; and it shall be answerable unto the holy oblation; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that labor in the city. [verse 19] And they that labor in the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall till it. [verse 2] And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, Asher, one [portion] . [verse 20] All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation four-square, with the possession of the city. [verse 21] And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city; in front of the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward in front of the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, answerable unto the portions, it shall be for the prince: and the holy oblation and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof. [verse 22] Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, it shall be for the prince. [verse 23] And as for the rest of the tribes: from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin, one [portion] . [verse 24] And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, Simeon, one [portion] . [verse 25] And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, Issachar, one [portion] . [verse 26] And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, Zebulun, one [portion] . [verse 27] And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, Gad, one [portion] . [verse 28] And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook [of Egypt], unto the great sea. [verse 29] This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their several portions, saith the Lord Jehovah. [verse 3] And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, Naphtali, one [portion] . [verse 30] And these are the egresses of the city: On the north side four thousand and five hundred [reeds] by measure; [verse 31] and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel, three gates northward: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one. [verse 32] And at the east side four thousand and five hundred [reeds], and three gates: even the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one. [verse 33] And at the south side four thousand and five hundred [reeds] by measure, and three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one. [verse 34] At the west side four thousand and five hundred [reeds], with their three gates: the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher, one; the gate of Naphtali, one. [verse 35] It shall be eighteen thousand [reeds] round about: and the name of the city from that day shall be, Jehovah is there. [verse 4] And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, Manasseh, one [portion] . [verse 5] And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side, Ephraim, one [portion] . [verse 6] And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, Reuben, one [portion] . [verse 7] And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, Judah, one [portion] . [verse 8] And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the oblation which ye shall offer, five and twenty thousand [reeds] in breadth, and in length as one of the portions, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it. [verse 9] The oblation that ye shall offer unto Jehovah shall be five and twenty thousand [reeds] in length, and ten thousand in breadth."
1922,Ezekiel 47:1-12,"[Ezekiel] [ch 47] [verse 1] And he brought me back unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward; (for the forefront of the house was toward the east;) and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar. [verse 10] And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand by it: from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many. [verse 11] But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given up to salt. [verse 12] And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not whither, neither shall the fruit thereof fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for healing. [verse 2] Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way without unto the outer gate, by the way of [the gate] that looketh toward the east; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side. [verse 3] When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles. [verse 4] Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through [the waters], waters that were to the loins. [verse 5] Afterward he measured a thousand; [and it was] a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. [verse 6] And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen [this] ? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river. [verse 7] Now when I had returned, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. [verse 8] Then said he unto me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah; and they shall go toward the sea; into the sea [shall the waters go] which were made to issue forth; and the waters shall be healed. [verse 9] And it shall come to pass, that every living creature which swarmeth, in every place whither the rivers come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters are come thither, and [the waters of the sea] shall be healed, and everything shall live whithersoever the river cometh."
1923,Ezekiel 47:3-5,"[Ezekiel] [ch 47] [verse 3] When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles. [verse 4] Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through [the waters], waters that were to the loins. [verse 5] Afterward he measured a thousand; [and it was] a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through."
1924,Ezekiel 47:12,"[Ezekiel] [ch 47] [verse 12] And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not whither, neither shall the fruit thereof fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for healing."
1925,Ezekiel 48:35,"[Ezekiel] [ch 48] [verse 35] It shall be eighteen thousand [reeds] round about: and the name of the city from that day shall be, Jehovah is there."
1926,Daniel 1:17,"[Daniel] [ch 1] [verse 17] Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams."
1927,Daniel 2:19,[Daniel] [ch 2] [verse 19] Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
1928,Daniel 2:24-45,"[Daniel] [ch 2] [verse 24] Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation. [verse 25] Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation. [verse 26] The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? [verse 27] Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show unto the king; [verse 28] but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these: [verse 29] as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came [into thy mind] upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass. [verse 30] But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart. [verse 31] Thou, O king, sawest, and, behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the aspect thereof was terrible. [verse 32] As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, [verse 33] its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay. [verse 34] Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them in pieces. [verse 35] Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. [verse 36] This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. [verse 37] Thou, O king, art king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory; [verse 38] and wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee to rule over them all: thou art the head of gold. [verse 39] And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. [verse 40] And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush. [verse 41] And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. [verse 42] And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. [verse 43] And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay. [verse 44] And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. [verse 45] Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure."
1929,Daniel 3:19-27,"[Daniel] [ch 3] [verse 19] Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: [therefore] he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated. [verse 20] And he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, [and] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. [verse 21] Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their mantles, and their [other] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. [verse 22] Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. [verse 23] And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. [verse 24] Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spake and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king. [verse 25] He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods. [verse 26] Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst of the fire. [verse 27] And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them."
1930,Daniel 3:25,"[Daniel] [ch 3] [verse 25] He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods."
1931,Daniel 3:27,"[Daniel] [ch 3] [verse 27] And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them."
1932,Daniel 4:4-18,"[Daniel] [ch 4] [verse 10] Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and the height thereof was great. [verse 11] The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth. [verse 12] The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed from it. [verse 13] I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven. [verse 14] He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches. [verse 15] Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth: [verse 16] let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him. [verse 17] The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the lowest of men. [verse 18] This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee. [verse 4] I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace. [verse 5] I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. [verse 6] Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream. [verse 7] Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof. [verse 8] But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him, [saying] , [verse 9] O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof."
1933,Daniel 4:19-27,"[Daniel] [ch 4] [verse 19] Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken dumb for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries. [verse 20] The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth; [verse 21] whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens had their habitation: [verse 22] it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong; for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth. [verse 23] And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him; [verse 24] this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king: [verse 25] that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. [verse 26] And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule. [verse 27] Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity."
1934,Daniel 4:28-33,"[Daniel] [ch 4] [verse 28] All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. [verse 29] At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon. [verse 30] The king spake and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty? [verse 31] While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, [saying], O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee: [verse 32] and thou shalt be driven from men; and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times shall pass over thee; until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. [verse 33] The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles' [feathers], and his nails like birds' [claws] ."
1935,Daniel 4:34-37,"[Daniel] [ch 4] [verse 34] And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him that liveth for ever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation. [verse 35] And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? [verse 36] At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added unto me. [verse 37] Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those that walk in pride he is able to abase."
1936,Daniel 5:5,"[Daniel] [ch 5] [verse 5] In the same hour came forth the fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote."
1937,Daniel 5:17-28,"[Daniel] [ch 5] [verse 17] Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. [verse 18] O thou king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty: [verse 19] and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down. [verse 20] But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: [verse 21] and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts', and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the Most High God ruleth in the kingdom of men, and that he setteth up over it whomsoever he will. [verse 22] And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this, [verse 23] but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine from them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified. [verse 24] Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed. [verse 25] And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. [verse 26] This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end; [verse 27] TEKEL; thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. [verse 28] PERES; thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians."
1938,Daniel 5:30,[Daniel] [ch 5] [verse 30] In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.
1939,Daniel 6:16-23,"[Daniel] [ch 6] [verse 16] Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. [Now] the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee. [verse 17] And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel. [verse 18] Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him. [verse 19] Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. [verse 20] And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? [verse 21] Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. [verse 22] My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt. [verse 23] Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God."
1940,Daniel 6:22,"[Daniel] [ch 6] [verse 22] My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt."
1941,Daniel 6:24,"[Daniel] [ch 6] [verse 24] And the king commanded, and they brought those men that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den."
1942,Daniel 7:1-28,"[Daniel] [ch 7] [verse 1] In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters. [verse 10] A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened. [verse 11] I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire. [verse 12] And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. [verse 13] I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. [verse 14] And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. [verse 15] As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. [verse 16] I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. [verse 17] These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth. [verse 18] But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. [verse 19] Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; [verse 2] Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea. [verse 20] and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other [horn] which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows. [verse 21] I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; [verse 22] until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. [verse 23] Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. [verse 24] And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings. [verse 25] And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time. [verse 26] But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. [verse 27] And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him. [verse 28] Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart. [verse 3] And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. [verse 4] The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a man's heart was given to it. [verse 5] And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. [ [verse 6] After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. [verse 7] After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. [verse 8] I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. [verse 9] I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, [and] the wheels thereof burning fire."
1943,Daniel 7:9-10,"[Daniel] [ch 7] [verse 10] A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened. [verse 9] I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, [and] the wheels thereof burning fire."
1944,Daniel 7:13-14,"[Daniel] [ch 7] [verse 13] I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. [verse 14] And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed."
1945,Daniel 7:15-28,"[Daniel] [ch 7] [verse 15] As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. [verse 16] I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. [verse 17] These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth. [verse 18] But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. [verse 19] Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; [verse 20] and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other [horn] which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows. [verse 21] I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; [verse 22] until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. [verse 23] Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. [verse 24] And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings. [verse 25] And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time. [verse 26] But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. [verse 27] And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him. [verse 28] Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart."
1946,Daniel 8:1-14,"[Daniel] [ch 8] [verse 1] In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me, Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. [verse 10] And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them. [verse 11] Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual [burnt-offering], and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. [verse 12] And the host was given over [to it] together with the continual [burnt-offering] through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did [its pleasure] and prospered. [verse 13] Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision [concerning] the continual [burnt-offering], and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? [verse 14] And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. [verse 2] And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai. [verse 3] Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. [verse 4] I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself. [verse 5] And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. [verse 6] And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power. [verse 7] And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. [verse 8] And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable [horns] toward the four winds of heaven. [verse 9] And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious [land] ."
1947,Daniel 8:15-26,"[Daniel] [ch 8] [verse 15] And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. [verse 16] And I heard a man's voice between [the banks of] the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. [verse 17] So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end. [verse 18] Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright. [verse 19] And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end. [verse 20] The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. [verse 21] And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. [verse 22] And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power. [verse 23] And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. [verse 24] And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do [his pleasure] ; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people. [verse 25] And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in [their] security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. [verse 26] And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days [to come] ."
1948,Daniel 8:27,"[Daniel] [ch 8] [verse 27] And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king's business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it."
1949,Daniel 9:3-19,"[Daniel] [ch 9] [verse 10] neither have we obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets. [verse 11] Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even turning aside, that they should not obey thy voice: therefore hath the curse been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against him. [verse 12] And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem. [verse 13] As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet have we not entreated the favor of Jehovah our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in thy truth. [verse 14] Therefore hath Jehovah watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth, and we have not obeyed his voice. [verse 15] And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. [verse 16] O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, let thine anger and thy wrath, I pray thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are round about us. [verse 17] Now therefore, O our God, hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake. [verse 18] O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness, but for thy great mercies' sake. [verse 19] O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God, because thy city and thy people are called by thy name. [verse 3] And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes. [verse 4] And I prayed unto Jehovah my God, and made confession, and said, Oh, Lord, the great and dreadful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments, [verse 5] we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from thy precepts and from thine ordinances; [verse 6] neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, that spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. [verse 7] O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee. [verse 8] O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee. [verse 9] To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness; for we have rebelled against him;"
1950,Daniel 9:20-23,"[Daniel] [ch 9] [verse 20] And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God; [verse 21] yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation. [verse 22] And he instructed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee wisdom and understanding. [verse 23] At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment went forth, and I am come to tell thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision."
1951,Daniel 9:24-27,"[Daniel] [ch 9] [verse 24] Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy. [verse 25] Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the anointed one, the prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: it shall be built again, with street and moat, even in troublous times. [verse 26] And after the threescore and two weeks shall the anointed one be cut off, and shall have nothing: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and even unto the end shall be war; desolations are determined. [verse 27] And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease; and upon the wing of abominations [shall come] one that maketh desolate; and even unto the full end, and that determined, shall [wrath] be poured out upon the desolate."
1952,Daniel 10:1,"[Daniel] [ch 10] [verse 1] In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision."
1953,Daniel 10:4-6,"[Daniel] [ch 10] [verse 4] And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel, [verse 5] I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz: [verse 6] his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like unto burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude."
1954,Daniel 10:7-9,"[Daniel] [ch 10] [verse 7] And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves. [verse 8] So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength. [verse 9] Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground."
1955,"Daniel 10:10-11, 16, 18","[Daniel] [ch 10] [verse 10] And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. [verse 11] And he said unto me, O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling. [verse 16] And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I retain no strength. [verse 18] Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me."
1956,Daniel 10:12-14,"[Daniel] [ch 10] [verse 12] Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard: and I am come for thy words' sake. [verse 13] But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia. [verse 14] Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for [many] days:"
1957,"Daniel 10:13, 20","[Daniel] [ch 10] [verse 13] But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia. [verse 20] Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come."
1958,"Daniel 10:13, 21","[Daniel] [ch 10] [verse 13] But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia. [verse 21] But I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me against these, but Michael your prince."
1959,Daniel 11:2-45,"[Daniel] [ch 11] [verse 10] And his sons shall war, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall come on, and overflow, and pass through; and they shall return and war, even to his fortress. [verse 11] And the king of the south shall be moved with anger, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north; and he shall set forth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand. [verse 12] And the multitude shall be lifted up, and his heart shall be exalted; and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail. [verse 13] And the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former; and he shall come on at the end of the times, [even of] years, with a great army and with much substance. [verse 14] And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the children of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they shall fall. [verse 15] So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city: and the forces of the south shall not stand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to stand. [verse 16] But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the glorious land, and in his hand shall be destruction. [verse 17] And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions; and he shall perform them: and he shall give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her; but she shall not stand, neither be for him. [verse 18] After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; yea, moreover, he shall cause his reproach to turn upon him. [verse 19] Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found. [verse 2] And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and when he is waxed strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece. [verse 20] Then shall stand up in his place one that shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle. [verse 21] And in his place shall stand up a contemptible person, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in time of security, and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries. [ [verse 22] And the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant. [verse 23] And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully; for he shall come up, and shall become strong, with a small people. [verse 24] In time of security shall he come even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance: yea, he shall devise his devices against the strongholds, even for a time. [verse 25] And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army; but he shall not stand; for they shall devise devices against him. [verse 26] Yea, they that eat of his dainties shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow; and many shall fall down slain. [verse 27] And as for both these kings, their hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table: but it shall not prosper; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed. [verse 28] Then shall he return into his land with great substance; and his heart [shall be] against the holy covenant; and he shall do [his pleasure], and return to his own land. [verse 29] At the time appointed he shall return, and come into the south; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former. [verse 3] And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. [verse 30] For ships of Kittim shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved, and shall return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and shall do [his pleasure] : he shall even return, and have regard unto them that forsake the holy covenant. [verse 31] And forces shall stand on his part, and they shall profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and shall take away the continual [burnt-offering], and they shall set up the abomination that maketh desolate. [verse 32] And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries; but the people that know their God shall be strong, and do [exploits] . [verse 33] And they that are wise among the people shall instruct many; yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, [many] days. [verse 34] Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help; but many shall join themselves unto them with flatteries. [verse 35] And some of them that are wise shall fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed. [verse 36] And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods; and he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined shall be done. [verse 37] Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall magnify himself above all. [verse 38] But in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things. [verse 39] And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god: whosoever acknowledgeth [him] he will increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for a price. [verse 4] And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides these. [verse 40] And at the time of the end shall the king of the south contend with him; and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass through. [verse 41] He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many [countries] shall be overthrown; but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon. [verse 42] He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries; and the land of Egypt shall not escape. [verse 43] But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps. [verse 44] But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many. [verse 45] And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him. [verse 5] And the king of the south shall be strong, and [one] of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion. [verse 6] And at the end of years they shall join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm; but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in those times. [verse 7] But out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place, who shall come unto the army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail. [verse 8] And also their gods, with their molten images, [and] with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, shall he carry captive into Egypt; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north. [verse 9] And he shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land."
1960,Daniel 12:1-4,"[Daniel] [ch 12] [verse 1] And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. [verse 2] And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. [verse 3] And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. [verse 4] But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased."

1962,Daniel 12:5,"[Daniel] [ch 12] [verse 5] Then I, Daniel, looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on the brink of the river on this side, and the other on the brink of the river on that side."
1963,Daniel 12:6-7,"[Daniel] [ch 12] [verse 6] And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? [verse 7] And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished."

[verse 11] And from the time that the continual [burnt-offering] shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand and two hundred and ninety days. [verse 12] Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. [verse 13] But go thou thy way till the end be; for thou shalt rest, and shalt stand in thy lot, at the end of the days. [verse 9] And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end."
1966,Hosea 1:2-3,"[Hosea] [ch 1] [verse 2] When Jehovah spake at the first by Hosea, Jehovah said unto Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom; for the land doth commit great whoredom, [departing] from Jehovah. [verse 3] So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bare him a son."
1967,Hosea 1:4-9,"[Hosea] [ch 1] [verse 4] And Jehovah said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease. [verse 5] And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. [verse 6] And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And [Jehovah] said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them. [verse 7] But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by Jehovah their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. [verse 8] Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son. [verse 9] And [Jehovah] said, Call his name Lo-ammi; for ye are not my people, and I will not be your [God] ."

[verse 11] And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up from the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel."
1970,Hosea 2:2-23,"[Hosea] [ch 2] [verse 10] And now will I uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand. [verse 11] I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies. [verse 12] And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, whereof she hath said, These are my hire that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them. [verse 13] And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, unto which she burned incense, when she decked herself with her ear-rings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith Jehovah. [verse 14] Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. [verse 15] And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall make answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. [verse 16] And it shall be at that day, saith Jehovah, that thou shalt call me Ishi, and shalt call me no more Baali. [verse 17] For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name. [verse 18] And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely. [verse 19] And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. [verse 2] Contend with your mother, contend; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts; [verse 20] I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know Jehovah. [verse 21] And it shall come to pass in that day, I will answer, saith Jehovah, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth; [verse 22] and the earth shall answer the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Jezreel. [verse 23] And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them that were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, [Thou art] my God. [verse 3] lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst. [verse 4] Yea, upon her children will I have no mercy; for they are children of whoredom; [verse 5] for their mother hath played the harlot; she that conceived them hath done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink. [verse 6] Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths. [verse 7] And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now. [verse 8] For she did not know that I gave her the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal. [verse 9] Therefore will I take back my grain in the time thereof, and my new wine in the season thereof, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness."
1971,Hosea 2:9-12,"[Hosea] [ch 2] [verse 10] And now will I uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.

1973,Hosea 3:1-3,"[Hosea] [ch 3] [verse 1] And Jehovah said unto me, Go again, love a woman beloved of [her] friend, and an adulteress, even as Jehovah loveth the children of Israel, though they turn unto other gods, and love cakes of raisins. [verse 2] So I bought her to me for fifteen [pieces] of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley; [verse 3] and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any man's wife: so will I also be toward thee."
1974,Hosea 4:1-19,"[Hosea] [ch 4] [verse 1] Hear the word of Jehovah, ye children of Israel; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land. [verse 10] And they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall play the harlot, and shall not increase; because they have left off taking heed to Jehovah. [verse 11] Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding. [verse 12] My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of whoredom hath caused them to err, and they have played the harlot, [departing] from under their God. [verse 13] They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters play the harlot, and your brides commit adultery. [verse 14] I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for [the men] themselves go apart with harlots, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes; and the people that doth not understand shall be overthrown. [verse 15] Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Jehovah liveth. [verse 16] For Israel hath behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a large place. [verse 17] Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone. [verse 18] Their drink is become sour; they play the harlot continually; her rulers dearly love shame. [verse 19] The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall be put to shame because of their sacrifices. [verse 2] There is nought but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood. [verse 3] Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away. [verse 4] Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest. [verse 5] And thou shalt stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother. [verse 6] My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children. [verse 7] As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame. [verse 8] They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity. [verse 9] And it shall be, like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings."
1975,Hosea 5:1-15,"[Hosea] [ch 5] [verse 1] Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, O house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king; for unto you pertaineth the judgment; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. [verse 10] The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. [verse 11] Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was content to walk after [man's] command. [verse 12] Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness. [verse 13] When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah [saw] his wound, then went Ephraim to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound. [verse 14] For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver. [verse 15] I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly. [verse 2] And the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all. [verse 3] I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast played the harlot, Israel is defiled. [verse 4] Their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their God; for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not Jehovah. [verse 5] And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them. [verse 6] They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find him: he hath withdrawn himself from them. [verse 7] They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields. [verse 8] Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind thee, O Benjamin. [verse 9] Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be."

[verse 11] They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith Jehovah. [verse 2] The more [the prophets] called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. [verse 3] Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them. [verse 4] I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that lift up the yoke on their jaws; and I laid food before them. [verse 5] They shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be their king, because they refused to return [to me] . [verse 6] And the sword shall fall upon their cities, and shall consume their bars, and devour [them], because of their own counsels. [verse 7] And my people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to [him that is] on high, none at all will exalt [him] . [verse 8] How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? [how] shall I cast thee off, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? [how] shall I set thee as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together. [verse 9] I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in wrath."

1980,Hosea 14:1-9,"[Hosea] [ch 14] [verse 1] O Israel, return unto Jehovah thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. [verse 2] Take with you words, and return unto Jehovah: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: so will we render [as] bullocks [the offering of] our lips. [verse 3] Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, [Ye are] our gods; for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. [verse 4] I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from him. [verse 5] I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. [verse 6] His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon. [verse 7] They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive [as] the grain, and blossom as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. [verse 8] Ephraim [shall say], What have I to do any more with idols? I have answered, and will regard him: I am like a green fir-tree; from me is thy fruit found. [verse 9] Who is wise, that he may understand these things? prudent, that he may know them? for the ways of Jehovah are right, and the just shall walk in them; but transgressors shall fall therein."

[verse 12] The vine is withered, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field are withered: for joy is withered away from the sons of men. [verse 17] The seeds rot under their clods; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the grain is withered. [verse 18] How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. [verse 19] O Jehovah, to thee do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.

I cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save. [verse 3] Why dost thou show me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? for destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention riseth up. [verse 4] Therefore the law is slacked, and justice doth never go forth; for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore justice goeth forth perverted."
2112,Habakkuk 1:5-11,"[Habakkuk] [ch 1] [verse 10] Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a derision unto him; he derideth every stronghold; for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it. [verse 11] Then shall he sweep by [as] a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty, [even] he whose might is his god. [verse 5] Behold ye among the nations, and look, and wonder marvellously; for I am working a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you. [verse 6] For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs. [verse 7] They are terrible and dreadful; their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves. [verse 8] Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen press proudly on: yea, their horsemen come from far; they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour. [verse 9] They come all of them for violence; the set of their faces is forwards; and they gather captives as the sand."
2113,Habakkuk 1:12-17,"[Habakkuk] [ch 1] [verse 12] Art not thou from everlasting, O Jehovah my God, my Holy One? we shall not die. O Jehovah, thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast established him for correction. [verse 13] Thou that art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness, wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he; [verse 14] and makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them? [verse 15] He taketh up all of them with the angle, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them in his drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad. [verse 16] Therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; because by them his portion is fat, and his food plenteous. [verse 17] Shall he therefore empty his net, and spare not to slay the nations continually?"
2114,Habakkuk 2:1-3,"[Habakkuk] [ch 2] [verse 1] I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will look forth to see what he will speak with me, and what I shall answer concerning my complaint. [verse 2] And Jehovah answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it. [verse 3] For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hasteth toward the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not delay."

[verse 11] For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it. [verse 12] Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity! [verse 13] Behold, is it not of Jehovah of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity? [verse 14] For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea. [verse 15] Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, [to thee] that addest thy venom, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness! [verse 16] Thou art filled with shame, and not glory: drink thou also, and be as one uncircumcised; the cup of Jehovah's right hand shall come round unto thee, and foul shame shall be upon thy glory. [verse 17] For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein. [verse 18] What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he that fashioneth its form trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? [verse 19] Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it. [verse 20] But Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him. [verse 5] Yea, moreover, wine is treacherous, a haughty man, that keepeth not at home; who enlargeth his desire as Sheol, and he is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all peoples. [verse 6] Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and that ladeth himself with pledges! [ [verse 7] Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booty unto them? [verse 8] Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder thee, because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein. [verse 9] Woe to him that getteth an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!"

2139,Zephaniah 1:4-6,"[Zephaniah] [ch 1] [verse 4] And I will stretch out my hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, [and] the name of the Chemarim with the priests; [verse 5] and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship, that swear to Jehovah and swear by Malcam; [verse 6] and them that are turned back from following Jehovah; and those that have not sought Jehovah, nor inquired after him."

2142,Zephaniah 1:12,"[Zephaniah] [ch 1] [verse 12] And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps; and I will punish the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good, neither will he do evil."
2143,Zephaniah 1:14-18,"[Zephaniah] [ch 1] [verse 14] The great day of Jehovah is near, it is near and hasteth greatly, [even] the voice of the day of Jehovah; the mighty man crieth there bitterly. [verse 15] That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, [verse 16] a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements. [verse 17] And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against Jehovah; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung. [verse 18] Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he will make an end, yea, a terrible end, of all them that dwell in the land."
2144,Zephaniah 2:1-3,"[Zephaniah] [ch 2] [verse 1] Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation that hath no shame; [verse 2] before the decree bring forth, [before] the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah's anger come upon you.

2145,Zephaniah 2:4-7,"[Zephaniah] [ch 2] [verse 4] For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up. [verse 5] Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant. [verse 6] And the sea-coast shall be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks. [verse 7] And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed [their flocks] thereupon; in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for Jehovah their God will visit them, and bring back their captivity."

2147,Zephaniah 2:8-11,"[Zephaniah] [ch 2] [verse 10] This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts. [verse 11] Jehovah will be terrible unto them; for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the nations. [verse 8] I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border. [verse 9] Therefore as I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall make a prey of them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them."
2148,Zephaniah 2:11,"[Zephaniah] [ch 2] [verse 11] Jehovah will be terrible unto them; for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the nations."

[verse 14] And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall lodge in the capitals thereof; [their] voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he hath laid bare the cedar-work. [verse 15] This is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand."

2151,Zephaniah 3:1-8,"[Zephaniah] [ch 3] [verse 1] Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted! to the oppressing city! [verse 2] She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in Jehovah; she drew not near to her God. [verse 3] Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing till the morrow. [verse 4] Her prophets are light and treacherous persons; her priests have profaned the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law. [verse 5] Jehovah in the midst of her is righteous; he will not do iniquity; every morning doth he bring his justice to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame. [verse 6] I have cut off nations; their battlements are desolate; I have made their streets waste, so that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant. [verse 7] I said, Only fear thou me; receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, [according to] all that I have appointed concerning her: but they rose early and corrupted all their doings. [verse 8] Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy."

2155,Zephaniah 3:11-13,"[Zephaniah] [ch 3] [verse 11] In that day shalt thou not be put to shame for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain. [verse 12] But I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall take refuge in the name of Jehovah. [verse 13] The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid."
2156,Zephaniah 3:14-17,"[Zephaniah] [ch 3] [verse 14] Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. [verse 15] Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the King of Israel, even Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not fear evil any more. [verse 16] In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack. [verse 17] Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing."

[verse 19] Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save that which is lame, and gather that which was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth. [verse 20] At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah."

2160,Haggai 1:1-2,"[Haggai] [ch 1] [verse 1] In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying, [verse 2] Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, This people say, It is not the time [for us] to come, the time for Jehovah's house to be built."
2161,Haggai 1:3-6,"[Haggai] [ch 1] [verse 3] Then came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying, [verse 4] Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your ceiled houses, while this house lieth waste? [verse 5] Now therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways. [verse 6] Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages [to put it] into a bag with holes."
2162,Haggai 1:7-8,"[Haggai] [ch 1] [verse 7] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways. [verse 8] Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith Jehovah."
2163,Haggai 1:9-11,"[Haggai] [ch 1] [verse 10] Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholdeth its fruit. [verse 11] And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the grain, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands. [verse 9] Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith Jehovah of hosts. Because of my house that lieth waste, while ye run every man to his own house."
2164,Haggai 1:14,"[Haggai] [ch 1] [verse 14] And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work on the house of Jehovah of hosts, their God,"
2165,Haggai 1:13,"[Haggai] [ch 1] [verse 13] Then spake Haggai Jehovah's messenger in Jehovah's message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith Jehovah."
2166,Haggai 2:1-3,"[Haggai] [ch 2] [verse 1] In the seventh [month], in the one and twentieth [day] of the month, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying, [verse 2] Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying, [verse 3] Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes as nothing?"
2167,Haggai 2:4-5,"[Haggai] [ch 2] [verse 4] Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith Jehovah; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith Jehovah, and work: for I am with you, saith Jehovah of hosts, [verse 5] [according to] the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, and my Spirit abode among you: fear ye not."
2168,Haggai 2:6-7,"[Haggai] [ch 2] [verse 6] For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; [verse 7] and I will shake all nations; and the precious things of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, saith Jehovah of hosts."

2172,Haggai 2:10-14,"[Haggai] [ch 2] [verse 10] In the four and twentieth [day] of the ninth [month], in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying, [verse 11] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying, [verse 12] If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No. [verse 13] Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean. [verse 14] Then answered Haggai and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith Jehovah; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean."
2173,Haggai 2:15-19,"[Haggai] [ch 2] [verse 15] And now, I pray you, consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of Jehovah. [verse 16] Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty [measures], there were but ten; when one came to the winevat to draw out fifty [vessels], there were but twenty. [verse 17] I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands; yet ye [turned] not to me, saith Jehovah. [verse 18] Consider, I pray you, from this day and backward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth [month], since the day that the foundation of Jehovah's temple was laid, consider it. [verse 19] Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree have not brought forth; from this day will I bless [you] ."
2174,Haggai 2:19,"[Haggai] [ch 2] [verse 19] Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree have not brought forth; from this day will I bless [you] ."
2175,Haggai 2:20-22,"[Haggai] [ch 2] [verse 20] And the word of Jehovah came the second time unto Haggai in the four and twentieth [day] of the month, saying, [verse 21] Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth; [verse 22] and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms; and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother."
2176,Haggai 2:23,"[Haggai] [ch 2] [verse 23] In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith Jehovah, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith Jehovah of hosts."

2178,Zechariah 1:7-17,"[Zechariah] [ch 1] [verse 10] And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth. [verse 11] And they answered the angel of Jehovah that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest. [verse 12] Then the angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years? [verse 13] And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me with good words, [even] comfortable words. [verse 14] So the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy. [verse 15] And I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction. [verse 16] Therefore thus saith Jehovah: I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem. [verse 17] Cry yet again, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity; and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. [verse 7] Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying, [verse 8] I saw in the night, and, behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white. [verse 9] Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show thee what these are."
2179,Zechariah 1:18-21,"[Zechariah] [ch 1] [verse 18] And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns. [verse 19] And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. [verse 20] And Jehovah showed me four smiths. [verse 21] Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head; but these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it."
2180,Zechariah 2:1-13,"[Zechariah] [ch 2] [verse 1] And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand. [verse 10] Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Jehovah. [verse 11] And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me unto thee. [verse 12] And Jehovah shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. [verse 13] Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation. [verse 2] Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof. [verse 3] And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, [verse 4] and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein. [verse 5] For I, saith Jehovah, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her. [verse 6] Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, saith Jehovah; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, saith Jehovah. [verse 7] Ho Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. [verse 8] For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: After glory hath he sent me unto the nations which plundered you; for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. [verse 9] For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me."
2181,Zechariah 2:5,"[Zechariah] [ch 2] [verse 5] For I, saith Jehovah, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her."
2182,Zechariah 3:1-10,"[Zechariah] [ch 3] [verse 1] And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary. [verse 10] In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, shall ye invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig-tree. [verse 2] And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan; yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire? [verse 3] Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel. [verse 4] And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with rich apparel. [verse 5] And I said, Let them set a clean mitre upon his head. So they set a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah was standing by. [ [verse 6] And the angel of Jehovah protested unto Joshua, saying, [verse 7] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee a place of access among these that stand by. [verse 8] Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men that are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch. [ [verse 9] For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; upon one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day."
2183,Zechariah 3:2,"[Zechariah] [ch 3] [verse 2] And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan; yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?"
2184,Zechariah 3:9,"[Zechariah] [ch 3] [verse 9] For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; upon one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day."
2185,Zechariah 4:1-14,"[Zechariah] [ch 4] [verse 1] And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep. [verse 10] For who hath despised the day of small things? for these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; [these are] the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth. [verse 11] Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof? [verse 12] And I answered the second time, and said unto him, What are these two olive-branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that empty the golden [oil] out of themselves? [verse 13] And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord. [verse 14] Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth. [verse 2] And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have seen, and, behold, a candlestick all of gold, with its bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are upon the top thereof; [verse 3] and two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. [verse 4] And I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord? [verse 5] Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord. [verse 6] Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts. [verse 7] Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel [thou shalt become] a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace, unto it. [verse 8] Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, [verse 9] The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you."
2186,Zechariah 4:6,"[Zechariah] [ch 4] [verse 6] Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts."
2187,Zechariah 4:7,"[Zechariah] [ch 4] [verse 7] Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel [thou shalt become] a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace, unto it."
2188,Zechariah 5:1-4,"[Zechariah] [ch 5] [verse 1] Then again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a flying roll. [verse 2] And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits. [verse 3] Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole land: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off on the one side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off on the other side according to it. [verse 4] I will cause it to go forth, saith Jehovah of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name; and it shall abide in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof."
2189,Zechariah 5:5-11,"[Zechariah] [ch 5] [verse 10] Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? [verse 11] And he said unto me, To build her a house in the land of Shinar: and when it is prepared, she shall be set there in her own place. [verse 5] Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth. [verse 6] And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their appearance in all the land [verse 7] (and, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead); and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah. [verse 8] And he said, This is Wickedness: and he cast her down into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. [verse 9] Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings; now they had wings like the wings of a stork; and they lifted up the ephah between earth and heaven."
2190,Zechariah 6:1-8,"[Zechariah] [ch 6] [verse 1] And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. [verse 2] In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; [verse 3] and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses. [verse 4] Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? [verse 5] And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. [verse 6] [ The chariot] wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country. [verse 7] And the strong went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. [verse 8] Then cried he to me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, they that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country."
2191,Zechariah 6:9-15,"[Zechariah] [ch 6] [verse 10] Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they are come from Babylon; [verse 11] yea, take [of them] silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest; [verse 12] and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build the temple of Jehovah; [verse 13] even he shall build the temple of Jehovah; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. [verse 14] And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah. [verse 15] And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you. And [this] shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah your God. [verse 9] And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,"
2192,Zechariah 7:1-14,"[Zechariah] [ch 7] [verse 1] And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah in the fourth [day] of the ninth month, even in Chislev. [verse 10] and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the sojourner, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart. [verse 11] But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear. [verse 12] Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which Jehovah of hosts had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets: therefore there came great wrath from Jehovah of hosts. [verse 13] And it is come to pass that, as he cried, and they would not hear, so they shall cry, and I will not hear, said Jehovah of hosts; [verse 14] but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate. [verse 2] Now [they of] Beth-el had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to entreat the favor of Jehovah, [verse 3] [ and] to speak unto the priests of the house of Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years? [verse 4] Then came the word of Jehovah of hosts unto me, saying, [verse 5] Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh [month], even these seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me? [verse 6] And when ye eat, and when ye drink, do not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves? [verse 7] [ Should ye] not [hear] the words which Jehovah cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited? [verse 8] And the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah, saying, [verse 9] Thus hath Jehovah of hosts spoken, saying, Execute true judgment, and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother;"
2193,Zechariah 8:3,"[Zechariah] [ch 8] [verse 3] Thus saith Jehovah: I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth; and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, The holy mountain."
2194,Zechariah 8:4-23,"[Zechariah] [ch 8] [verse 10] For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in, because of the adversary: for I set all men every one against his neighbor. [verse 11] But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days, saith Jehovah of hosts. [verse 12] For [there shall be] the seed of peace; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. [verse 13] And it shall come to pass that, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing. Fear not, [but] let your hands be strong. [verse 14] For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: As I thought to do evil unto you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I repented not; [verse 15] so again have I thought in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not. [verse 16] These are the things that ye shall do: speak ye every man the truth with his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates; [verse 17] and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith Jehovah. [verse 18] And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me, saying, [verse 19] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The fast of the fourth [month], and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love truth and peace. [verse 20] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: [It shall] yet [come to pass], that there shall come peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities; [verse 21] and the inhabitants of one [city] shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of hosts: I will go also. [verse 22] Yea, many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of Jehovah. [verse 23] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days [it shall come to pass], that ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you. [verse 4] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age. [verse 5] And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. [verse 6] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith Jehovah of hosts. [verse 7] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country; [verse 8] and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness. [verse 9] Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets that were in the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built."
2195,Zechariah 9:1-8,"[Zechariah] [ch 9] [verse 1] The burden of the word of Jehovah upon the land of Hadrach, and Damascus [shall be] its resting-place (for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Jehovah); [verse 2] and Hamath, also, which bordereth thereon; Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise. [verse 3] And Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. [verse 4] Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. [verse 5] Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also, and shall be sore pained; and Ekron, for her expectation shall be put to shame; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. [verse 6] And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. [verse 7] And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; and he also shall be a remnant for our God; and he shall be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite. [verse 8] And I will encamp about my house against the army, that none pass through or return; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes."
2196,Zechariah 9:9-10,"[Zechariah] [ch 9] [verse 10] And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace unto the nations: and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. [verse 9] Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy king cometh unto thee; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass."
2197,Zechariah 9:11-17,"[Zechariah] [ch 9] [verse 11] As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I have set free thy prisoners from the pit wherein is no water. [verse 12] Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even to-day do I declare that I will render double unto thee. [verse 13] For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man. [verse 14] And Jehovah shall be seen over them; and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south. [verse 15] Jehovah of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, like the corners of the altar. [verse 16] And Jehovah their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people; for [they shall be as] the stones of a crown, lifted on high over his land. [verse 17] For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins."
2198,Zechariah 10:1,"[Zechariah] [ch 10] [verse 1] Ask ye of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain, [even of] Jehovah that maketh lightnings; and he will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field."
2199,Zechariah 10:8-12,"[Zechariah] [ch 10] [verse 10] I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and [place] shall not be found for them. [verse 11] And he will pass through the sea of affliction, and will smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart. [verse 12] And I will strengthen them in Jehovah; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith Jehovah. [verse 8] I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them; and they shall increase as they have increased. [verse 9] And I will sow them among the peoples; and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and shall return."
2200,Zechariah 11:1-17,"[Zechariah] [ch 11] [verse 1] Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. [verse 10] And I took my staff Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. [verse 11] And it was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that gave heed unto me knew that it was the word of Jehovah. [verse 12] And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my hire thirty [pieces] of silver. [verse 13] And Jehovah said unto me, Cast it unto the potter, the goodly price that I was prized at by them. And I took the thirty [pieces] of silver, and cast them unto the potter, in the house of Jehovah. [verse 14] Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. [verse 15] And Jehovah said unto me, Take unto thee yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd. [verse 16] For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those that are cut off, neither will seek those that are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the flesh of the fat [sheep], and will tear their hoofs in pieces. [verse 17] Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened. [verse 2] Wail, O fir-tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the goodly ones are destroyed: wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down. [verse 3] A voice of the wailing of the shepherds! for their glory is destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions! for the pride of the Jordan is laid waste. [verse 4] Thus said Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of slaughter; [verse 5] whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they that sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich; and their own shepherds pity them not. [verse 6] For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah; but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbor's hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them. [verse 7] So I fed the flock of slaughter, verily the poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. [verse 8] And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me. [verse 9] Then said I, I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let them that are left eat every one the flesh of another."
2201,Zechariah 12:2-3,"[Zechariah] [ch 12] [verse 2] behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling unto all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem. [verse 3] And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it."
2202,Zechariah 12:9,"[Zechariah] [ch 12] [verse 9] And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem."
2203,Zechariah 12:10,"[Zechariah] [ch 12] [verse 10] And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look unto me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born."
2204,Zechariah 13:1,"[Zechariah] [ch 13] [verse 1] In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness."
2205,Zechariah 13:2,"[Zechariah] [ch 13] [verse 2] And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land."
2206,Zechariah 13:7,"[Zechariah] [ch 13] [verse 7] Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith Jehovah of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn my hand upon the little ones."
2207,Zechariah 13:9,"[Zechariah] [ch 13] [verse 9] And I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, Jehovah is my God."
2208,Zechariah 14:1-21,"[Zechariah] [ch 14] [verse 1] Behold, a day of Jehovah cometh, when thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee. [verse 10] All the land shall be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she shall be lifted up, and shall dwell in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel unto the king's wine-presses. [verse 11] And men shall dwell therein, and there shall be no more curse; but Jerusalem shall dwell safely. [verse 12] And this shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite all the peoples that have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their sockets, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. [verse 13] And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from Jehovah shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor. [verse 14] And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance. [verse 15] And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in those camps, as that plague. [verse 16] And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. [verse 17] And it shall be, that whoso of [all] the families of the earth goeth not up unto Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, upon them there shall be no rain. [verse 18] And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, neither [shall it be] upon them; there shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. [verse 19] This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. [verse 2] For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city. [verse 20] In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLY UNTO JEHOVAH; and the pots in Jehovah's house shall be like the bowls before the altar. [verse 21] Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy unto Jehovah of hosts; and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and boil therein: and in that day there shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah of hosts. [verse 3] Then shall Jehovah go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle. [verse 4] And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the mount of Olives shall be cleft in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, [and there shall be] a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south. [verse 5] And ye shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azel; yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; and Jehovah my God shall come, and all the holy ones with thee. [verse 6] And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light; the bright ones shall withdraw themselves: [verse 7] but it shall be one day which is known unto Jehovah; not day, and not night; but it shall come to pass, that at evening time there shall be light. [verse 8] And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea: in summer and in winter shall it be. [verse 9] And Jehovah shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall Jehovah be one, and his name one."
2209,Zechariah 14:4,"[Zechariah] [ch 14] [verse 4] And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the mount of Olives shall be cleft in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, [and there shall be] a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south."
2210,Zechariah 14:12-15,"[Zechariah] [ch 14] [verse 12] And this shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite all the peoples that have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their sockets, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. [verse 13] And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from Jehovah shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor. [verse 14] And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance. [verse 15] And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in those camps, as that plague."
2211,Zechariah 14:9,"[Zechariah] [ch 14] [verse 9] And Jehovah shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall Jehovah be one, and his name one."
2212,Malachi 1:2-5,"[Malachi] [ch 1] [verse 2] I have loved you, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith Jehovah: yet I loved Jacob; [verse 3] but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and [gave] his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness. [verse 4] Whereas Edom saith, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever. [verse 5] And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Jehovah be magnified beyond the border of Israel."
2213,Malachi 1:6-14,"[Malachi] [ch 1] [verse 10] Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle [fire on] mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. [verse 11] For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name [shall be] great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense [shall be] offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name [shall be] great among the Gentiles, saith Jehovah of hosts. [verse 12] But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of Jehovah is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even its food, is contemptible. [verse 13] Ye say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? saith Jehovah. [verse 14] But cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the Gentiles. [verse 6] A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is mine honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? [verse 7] Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar. And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible. [verse 8] And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when ye offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts. [verse 9] And now, I pray you, entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts."
2214,Malachi 2:1-3,"[Malachi] [ch 2] [verse 1] And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you. [verse 2] If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith Jehovah of hosts, then will I send the curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings; yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart. [verse 3] Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and ye shall be taken away with it."
2215,Malachi 2:4-9,"[Malachi] [ch 2] [verse 4] And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant may be with Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts. [verse 5] My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and stood in awe of my name. [verse 6] The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity. [verse 7] For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts. [verse 8] But ye are turned aside out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble in the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts. [verse 9] Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have had respect of persons in the law."
2216,Malachi 2:10-16,"[Malachi] [ch 2] [verse 10] Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers? [verse 11] Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of Jehovah which he loveth, and hath married the daughter of a foreign god. [verse 12] Jehovah will cut off, to the man that doeth this, him that waketh and him that answereth, out of the tents of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto Jehovah of hosts. [verse 13] And this again ye do: ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, neither receiveth it with good will at your hand. [verse 14] Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because Jehovah hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously, though she is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant. [verse 15] And did he not make one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? And wherefore one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. [verse 16] For I hate putting away, saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, and him that covereth his garment with violence, saith Jehovah of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously."
2217,Malachi 3:1,"[Malachi] [ch 3] [verse 1] Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom ye desire, behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts."
2218,Malachi 3:1-5,"[Malachi] [ch 3] [verse 1] Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom ye desire, behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts. [verse 2] But who can abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap: [verse 3] and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah offerings in righteousness. [verse 4] Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. [verse 5] And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the sojourner [from his right], and fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts."

[verse 11] And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, saith Jehovah of hosts. [verse 12] And all nations shall call you happy; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith Jehovah of hosts. [verse 8] Will a man rob God? yet ye rob me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. [verse 9] Ye are cursed with the curse; for ye rob me, even this whole nation."

[verse 2] But unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings; and ye shall go forth, and gambol as calves of the stall.

[verse 19] And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. [verse 20] But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. [verse 21] And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins. [verse 22] Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, [verse 23] Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, And they shall call his name Immanuel; which is, being interpreted, God with us. [verse 24] And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife; [verse 25] and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS."

[verse 2] Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

[verse 10] Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. [verse 11] Then the devil leaveth him; and behold, angels came and ministered unto him. [verse 2] And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward hungered. [verse 3] And the tempter came and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become bread. [verse 4] But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. [verse 5] Then the devil taketh him into the holy city; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple, [verse 6] and saith unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and, On their hands they shall bear thee up, lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone. [verse 7] Jesus said unto him, Again it is written, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.

2238,Matthew 8:5-13,"[Matthew] [ch 8] [verse 10] And when Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. [verse 11] And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: [verse 12] but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. [verse 13] And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; as thou hast believed, [so] be it done unto thee. And the servant was healed in that hour. [verse 5] And when he was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, [verse 6] and saying, Lord, my servant lieth in the house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.

[verse 25] And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Save, Lord; we perish. [verse 26] And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. [verse 27] And the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?"
2241,Matthew 8:28-34,"[Matthew] [ch 8] [verse 28] And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two possessed with demons, coming forth out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass by that way. [verse 29] And behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?

[verse 3] And behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth. [verse 4] And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? [verse 5] For which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk? [verse 6] But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (then saith he to the sick of the palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go up unto thy house. [verse 7] And he arose, and departed to his house. [verse 8] But when the multitudes saw it, they were afraid, and glorified God, who had given such authority unto men."

[verse 14] And he came forth, and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick. [verse 15] And when even was come, the disciples came to him, saying, The place is desert, and the time is already past; send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food. [verse 16] But Jesus said unto them, They have no need to go away; give ye them to eat. [verse 17] And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. [verse 18] And he said, Bring them hither to me. [verse 19] And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.

2249,Matthew 14:22-33,"[Matthew] [ch 14] [verse 22] And straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side, till he should send the multitudes away. [verse 23] And after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when even was come, he was there alone.

And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus. [verse 30] But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me. [verse 31] And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?

[verse 23] But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. [verse 24] But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. [verse 25] But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

[verse 33] And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude? [verse 34] And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes. [verse 35] And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; [verse 36] and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.

[verse 16] And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. [verse 17] And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him hither to me. [verse 18] And Jesus rebuked him; and the demon went out of him: and the boy was cured from that hour. [verse 19] Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast it out? [verse 20] And he saith unto them, Because of your little faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.

[verse 32] But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee. [verse 33] But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended. [verse 34] Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. [verse 35] Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee, [yet] will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples."
2266,Matthew 26:36-46,"[Matthew] [ch 26] [verse 36] Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray. [verse 37] And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled. [verse 38] Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me. [verse 39] And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt. [verse 40] And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? [verse 41] Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. [verse 42] Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done. [verse 43] And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. [verse 44] And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words. [verse 45] Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. [verse 46] Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me."
2267,Matthew 27:45,[Matthew] [ch 27] [verse 45] Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.

2270,Matthew 27:52-53,[Matthew] [ch 27] [verse 52] and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised; [verse 53] and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.
2271,Matthew 27:54,"[Matthew] [ch 27] [verse 54] Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God."
2272,Matthew 28:2,"[Matthew] [ch 28] [verse 2] And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it."
2273,Matthew 28:5-7,"[Matthew] [ch 28] [verse 5] And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, who hath been crucified. [verse 6] He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. [verse 7] And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you."
2274,Matthew 28:9-10,"[Matthew] [ch 28] [verse 10] Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me. [verse 9] And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him."
2275,Matthew 28:16-20,"[Matthew] [ch 28] [verse 16] But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them. [verse 17] And when they saw him, they worshipped [him] ; but some doubted. [verse 18] And Jesus came to them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth. [verse 19] Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: [verse 20] teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world."
2276,Mark 1:11,"[Mark] [ch 1] [verse 11] And a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased."
2277,Mark 1:10,"[Mark] [ch 1] [verse 10] And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:"
2278,Mark 1:12-13,[Mark] [ch 1] [verse 12] And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness. [verse 13] And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; And he was with the wild beasts; And the angels ministered unto him.
2279,Mark 1:21-28,"[Mark] [ch 1] [verse 21] And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. [verse 22] And they were astonished at his teaching: For he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. [verse 23] And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, [verse 24] saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. [verse 25] And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. [verse 26] And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. [verse 27] And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him. [verse 28] And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about."
2280,Mark 1:29-31,"[Mark] [ch 1] [verse 29] And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. [verse 30] Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her: [verse 31] and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them."
2281,Mark 1:32-34,"[Mark] [ch 1] [verse 32] And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons. [verse 33] And all the city was gathered together at the door. [verse 34] And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him ."
2282,Mark 1:40-45,"[Mark] [ch 1] [verse 40] And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. [verse 41] And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean. [verse 42] And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean. [verse 43] And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out, [verse 44] and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. [verse 45] But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter."
2283,Mark 2:1-12,"[Mark] [ch 2] [verse 1] And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was noised that he was in the house. [verse 10] But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy), [verse 11] I say unto thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house. [verse 12] And he arose, and straightway took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. [verse 2] And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room [for them], no, not even about the door: and he spake the word unto them. [verse 3] And they come, bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy, borne of four. [verse 4] And when they could not come nigh unto him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay. [verse 5] And Jesus seeing their faith saith unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven. [verse 6] But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, [verse 7] Why doth this man thus speak? he blasphemeth: who can forgive sins but one, [even] God? [verse 8] And straightway Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, saith unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? [verse 9] Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?"
2284,Mark 3:1-6,"[Mark] [ch 3] [verse 1] And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had his hand withered. [verse 2] And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him. [verse 3] And he saith unto the man that had his hand withered, Stand forth. [verse 4] And he saith unto them, Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill? But they held their peace. [verse 5] And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored. [verse 6] And the Pharisees went out, and straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him."
2285,Mark 3:7-12,"[Mark] [ch 3] [verse 10] for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him. [verse 11] And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. [verse 12] And he charged them much that they should not make him known. [verse 7] And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judaea, [verse 8] and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him. [verse 9] And he spake to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him:"
2286,Mark 4:35-41,"[Mark] [ch 4] [verse 35] And on that day, when even was come, he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side. [verse 36] And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him. [verse 37] And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling. [verse 38] And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say unto him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish? [verse 39] And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. [verse 40] And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful? have ye not yet faith? [verse 41] And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
2287,Mark 5:1-20,"[Mark] [ch 5] [verse 1] And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes. [verse 10] And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. [verse 11] Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding. [verse 12] And they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. [verse 13] And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, [in number] about two thousand; and they were drowned in the sea. [verse 14] And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass. [verse 15] And they come to Jesus, and behold him that was possessed with demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, [even] him that had the legion: and they were afraid. [verse 16] And they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine. [verse 17] And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders. [verse 18] And as he was entering into the boat, he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him. [verse 19] And he suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go to thy house unto thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and [how] he had mercy on thee. [verse 2] And when he was come out of the boat, straightway there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, [verse 20] And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men marvelled. [verse 3] who had his dwelling in the tombs: and no man could any more bind him, no, not with a chain; [verse 4] because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been rent asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: and no man had strength to tame him. [verse 5] And always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones. [verse 6] And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshipped him; [verse 7] and crying out with a loud voice, he saith, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, torment me not. [verse 8] For he said unto him, Come forth, thou unclean spirit, out of the man. [verse 9] And he asked him, What is thy name? And he saith unto him, My name is Legion; for we are many."
2288,Mark 5:25-34,"[Mark] [ch 5] [verse 25] And a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years, [verse 26] and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, [verse 27] having heard the things concerning Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment. [verse 28] For she said, If I touch but his garments, I shall be made whole. [verse 29] And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague. [verse 30] And straightway Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power [proceeding] from him had gone forth, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments? [verse 31] And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? [verse 32] And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. [verse 33] But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. [verse 34] And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague."
2289,"Mark 5:21-24, 35-43","[Mark] [ch 5] [verse 21] And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat unto the other side, a great multitude was gathered unto him; and he was by the sea. [verse 22] And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he falleth at his feet, [verse 23] and beseecheth him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: [I pray thee], that thou come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be made whole, and live. [verse 24] And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him. [verse 35] While he yet spake, they come from the ruler of the synagogue's [house] saying, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Teacher any further? [verse 36] But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe. [verse 37] And he suffered no man to follow with him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. [verse 38] And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he beholdeth a tumult, and [many] weeping and wailing greatly. [verse 39] And when he was entered in, he saith unto them, Why make ye a tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleepeth. [verse 40] And they laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all forth, taketh the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him, and goeth in where the child was. [verse 41] And taking the child by the hand, he saith unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise. [verse 42] And straightway the damsel rose up, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed straightway with a great amazement. [verse 43] And he charged them much that no man should know this: and he commanded that [something] should be given her to eat."
2290,Mark 6:1-6,"[Mark] [ch 6] [verse 1] And he went out from thence; and he cometh into his own country; and his disciples follow him. [verse 2] And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, Whence hath this man these things? and, What is the wisdom that is given unto this man, and [what mean] such mighty works wrought by his hands? [verse 3] Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him. [ [verse 4] And Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. [verse 5] And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them. [verse 6] And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages teaching."
2291,Mark 6:7,"[Mark] [ch 6] [verse 7] And he calleth unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits;"
2292,Mark 6:30-44,"[Mark] [ch 6] [verse 30] And the apostles gather themselves together unto Jesus; and they told him all things, whatsoever they had done, and whatsoever they had taught. [verse 31] And he saith unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. [verse 32] And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart. [verse 33] And [the people] saw them going, and many knew [them], and they ran together there on foot from all the cities, and outwent them. [verse 34] And he came forth and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things. [verse 35] And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, The place is desert, and the day is now far spent; [verse 36] send them away, that they may go into the country and villages round about, and buy themselves somewhat to eat. [verse 37] But he answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred shillings' worth of bread, and give them to eat? [verse 38] And he saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go [and] see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes. [verse 39] And he commanded them that all should sit down by companies upon the green grass. [verse 40] And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. [verse 41] And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves; and he gave to the disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all. [verse 42] And they all ate, and were filled. [verse 43] And they took up broken pieces, twelve basketfuls, and also of the fishes. [verse 44] And they that ate the loaves were five thousand men."
2293,Mark 6:45-52,"[Mark] [ch 6] [verse 45] And straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before [him] unto the other side to Bethsaida, while he himself sendeth the multitude away. [verse 46] And after he had taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray. [verse 47] And when even was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land. [verse 48] And seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them, about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking on the sea; and he would have passed by them: [verse 49] but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out; [verse 50] for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he straightway spake with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid. [verse 51] And he went up unto them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves; [verse 52] for they understood not concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened."
2294,Mark 6:53-56,"[Mark] [ch 6] [verse 53] And when they had crossed over, they came to the land unto Gennesaret, and moored to the shore. [verse 54] And when they were come out of the boat, straightway [the people] knew him, [verse 55] and ran round about that whole region, and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick, where they heard he was. [verse 56] And wheresoever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole."
2295,Mark 7:24-30,"[Mark] [ch 7] [verse 24] And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid. [verse 25] But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. [verse 26] Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter. [verse 27] And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs. [verse 28] But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. [verse 29] And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter. [verse 30] And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out."
2296,Mark 7:31-37,"[Mark] [ch 7] [verse 31] And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis. [verse 32] And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him. [verse 33] And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue; [verse 34] and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. [verse 35] And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. [verse 36] And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it. [verse 37] And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak."
2297,Mark 8:1-10,"[Mark] [ch 8] [verse 1] In those days, when there was again a great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, [verse 10] And straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha. [verse 2] I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: [verse 3] and if I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way; and some of them are come from far. [verse 4] And his disciples answered him, Whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place? [verse 5] And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. [verse 6] And he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; and they set them before the multitude. [verse 7] And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them. [verse 8] And they ate, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets. [verse 9] And they were about four thousand: and he sent them away."
2298,Mark 8:22-26,"[Mark] [ch 8] [verse 22] And they come unto Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him. [verse 23] And he took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, Seest thou aught? [verse 24] And he looked up, and said, I see men; for I behold [them] as trees, walking. [verse 25] Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked stedfastly, and was restored, and saw all things clearly. [verse 26] And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village."
2299,Mark 8:27-30,"[Mark] [ch 8] [verse 27] And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi: and on the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Who do men say that I am? [verse 28] And they told him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets. [verse 29] And he asked them, But who say ye that I am? Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ. [verse 30] And he charged them that they should tell no man of him."
2300,Mark 8:31-33,"[Mark] [ch 8] [verse 31] And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. [verse 32] And he spake the saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. [verse 33] But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and saith, Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of men."
2301,Mark 9:2-3,"[Mark] [ch 9] [verse 2] And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them; [verse 3] and his garments became glistering, exceeding white, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them."
2302,Mark 9:4,[Mark] [ch 9] [verse 4] And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.

2304,Mark 9:14-29,"[Mark] [ch 9] [verse 14] And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great multitude about them, and scribes questioning with them. [verse 15] And straightway all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him. [verse 16] And he asked them, What question ye with them? [verse 17] And one of the multitude answered him, Teacher, I brought unto thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit; [verse 18] and wheresoever it taketh him, it dasheth him down: and he foameth, and grindeth his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out; and they were not able. [ [verse 19] And he answereth them and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him unto me. [verse 20] And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him grievously; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming. [verse 21] And he asked his father, How long time is it since this hath come unto him? And he said, From a child. [verse 22] And oft-times it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us. [verse 23] And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth. [verse 24] Straightway the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. [verse 25] And when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. [verse 26] And having cried out, and torn him much, he came out: and [the boy] became as one dead; insomuch that the more part said, He is dead. [verse 27] But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose. [verse 28] And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, [How is it] that we could not cast it out? [verse 29] And he said unto them, This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer ."
2305,Mark 9:30-32,"[Mark] [ch 9] [verse 30] And they went forth from thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it. [verse 31] For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again. [verse 32] But they understood not the saying, and were afraid to ask him."
2306,Mark 10:32-34,"[Mark] [ch 10] [verse 32] And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and they that followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were to happen unto him, [verse 33] [ saying], Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles: [verse 34] and they shall mock him, and shall spit upon him, and shall scourge him, and shall kill him; and after three days he shall rise again."
2307,Mark 10:46-52,"[Mark] [ch 10] [verse 46] And they come to Jericho: and as he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the way side. [verse 47] And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. [verse 48] And many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. [verse 49] And Jesus stood still, and said, Call ye him. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good cheer: rise, he calleth thee. [verse 50] And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus. [verse 51] And Jesus answered him, and said, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight. [verse 52] And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And straightway he received his sight, and followed him in the way."
2308,"Mark 11:12-14, 20-25","[Mark] [ch 11] [verse 12] And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered. [verse 13] And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs. [verse 14] And he answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And his disciples heard it. [verse 20] And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. [verse 21] And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away. [verse 22] And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. [verse 23] Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it. [verse 24] Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. [verse 25] And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."
2309,Mark 13:1-2,"[Mark] [ch 13] [verse 1] And as he went forth out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Teacher, behold, what manner of stones and what manner of buildings! [verse 2] And Jesus said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left here one stone upon another, which shall not be thrown down."
2310,Mark 13:3-37,"[Mark] [ch 13] [verse 10] And the gospel must first be preached unto all the nations. [verse 11] And when they lead you [to judgment], and deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye; for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit. [verse 12] And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death. [verse 13] And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved. [verse 14] But when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not (let him that readeth understand), then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains: [verse 15] and let him that is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house: [verse 16] and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak. [verse 17] But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days! [verse 18] And pray ye that it be not in the winter. [verse 19] For those days shall be tribulation, such as there hath not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never shall be. [verse 20] And except the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the elect's sake, whom he chose, he shortened the days. [verse 21] And then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is the Christ; or, Lo, there; believe [it] not: [verse 22] for there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, the elect. [verse 23] But take ye heed: behold, I have told you all things beforehand. [verse 24] But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, [verse 25] and the stars shall be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken. [verse 26] And then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory. [verse 27] And then shall he send forth the angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven. [verse 28] Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that the summer is nigh; [verse 29] even so ye also, when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that he is nigh, [even] at the doors. [verse 3] And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, [verse 30] Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, until all these things be accomplished. [verse 31] Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. [verse 32] But of that day or that hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. [verse 33] Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. [verse 34] [ It is] as [when] a man, sojourning in another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, to each one his work, commanded also the porter to watch. [verse 35] Watch therefore: for ye know not when the lord of the house cometh, whether at even, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or in the morning; [verse 36] lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. [verse 37] And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch. [verse 4] Tell us, when shall these things be? and what [shall be] the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished? [verse 5] And Jesus began to say unto them, Take heed that no man lead you astray. [verse 6] Many shall come in my name, saying, I am [he] ; and shall lead many astray. [verse 7] And when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not troubled: [these things] must needs come to pass; but the end is not yet. [verse 8] For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there shall be earthquakes in divers places; there shall be famines: these things are the beginning of travail. [verse 9] But take ye heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in synagogues shall ye be beaten; and before governors and kings shall ye stand for my sake, for a testimony unto them."
2311,Mark 14:17-21,"[Mark] [ch 14] [verse 17] And when it was evening he cometh with the twelve. [verse 18] And as they sat and were eating, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you shall betray me, [even] he that eateth with me. [verse 19] They began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? [verse 20] And he said unto them, [It is] one of the twelve, he that dippeth with me in the dish. [verse 21] For the Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born."
2312,Mark 14:22-25,"[Mark] [ch 14] [verse 22] And as they were eating, he took bread, and when he had blessed, he brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take ye: this is my body. [verse 23] And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them: and they all drank of it. [verse 24] And he said unto them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. [verse 25] Verily I say unto you, I shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
2313,Mark 14:27-31,"[Mark] [ch 14] [verse 27] And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad. [verse 28] Howbeit, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee. [verse 29] But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I. [verse 30] And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that thou to-day, [even] this night, before the cock crow twice, shalt deny me thrice. [verse 31] But he spake exceedingly vehemently, If I must die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all."
2314,Mark 14:32-42,"[Mark] [ch 14] [verse 32] And they come unto a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I pray. [verse 33] And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly amazed, and sore troubled. [verse 34] And he saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death: abide ye here, and watch. [verse 35] And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him. [verse 36] And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; remove this cup from me: howbeit not what I will, but what thou wilt. [verse 37] And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest thou not watch one hour? [verse 38] Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. [verse 39] And again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words. [verse 40] And again he came, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they knew not what to answer him. [verse 41] And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough; the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. [verse 42] Arise, let us be going: behold, he that betrayeth me is at hand."

[verse 15] And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation. [verse 16] He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned. [verse 17] And these signs shall accompany them that believe: in my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues; [verse 18] they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."
2325,Mark 16:19,"[Mark] [ch 16] [verse 19] So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken unto them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God."

2327,Luke 1:11-20,"[Luke] [ch 1] [verse 11] And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of altar of incense. [verse 12] And Zacharias was troubled when he saw [him], and fear fell upon him. [verse 13] But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: because thy supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. [verse 14] And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. [verse 15] For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. [verse 16] And many of the children of Israel shall be turn unto the Lord their God. [verse 17] And he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient [to walk] in the wisdom of the just; to make ready for the Lord a people prepared [for him] . [verse 18] And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years. [verse 19] And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these good tidings. [verse 20] And behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season."

2329,Luke 1:26-38,"[Luke] [ch 1] [verse 26] Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, [verse 27] to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. [verse 28] And he came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord [is] with thee. [verse 29] But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be. [verse 30] And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God. [verse 31] And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. [verse 32] He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: [verse 33] and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. [verse 34] And Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? [verse 35] And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy thing which is begotten shall be called the Son of God. [verse 36] And behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren. [verse 37] For no word from God shall be void of power. [verse 38] And Mary said, Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her."

[verse 43] And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come unto me? [verse 44] For behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

[verse 49] For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; And holy is his name. [verse 50] And his mercy is unto generations and generations On them that fear him. [verse 51] He hath showed strength with his arm; He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart. [verse 52] He hath put down princes from [their] thrones, And hath exalted them of low degree. [verse 53] The hungry he hath filled with good things; And the rich he hath sent empty away. [verse 54] He hath given help to Israel his servant, That he might remember mercy [verse 55] (As he spake unto our fathers) Toward Abraham and his seed for ever."
2334,Luke 1:64,"[Luke] [ch 1] [verse 64] And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue [loosed], and he spake, blessing God."

[verse 76] Yea and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Most High: For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways; [verse 77] To give knowledge of salvation unto his people In the remission of their sins, [verse 78] Because of the tender mercy of our God, Whereby the dayspring from on high shall visit us, [verse 79] To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death; To guide our feet into the way of peace."

[verse 12] And this [is] the sign unto you: Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger. [verse 13] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, [verse 14] Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased.

2338,Luke 2:25-35,"[Luke] [ch 2] [verse 25] And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him. [verse 26] And it had been revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ. [verse 27] And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law, [verse 28] then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said, [verse 29] Now lettest thou thy servant depart, Lord, According to thy word, in peace; [verse 30] For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, [verse 31] Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples; [verse 32] A light for revelation to the Gentiles, And the glory of thy people Israel. [verse 33] And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him; [verse 34] and Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this [child] is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken against; [verse 35] yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed."

[verse 13] And when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him for a season. [verse 2] during forty days, being tempted of the devil. And he did eat nothing in those days: and when they were completed, he hungered. [verse 3] And the devil said unto him, if thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it become bread. [verse 4] And Jesus answered unto him, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone. [verse 5] And he led him up, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

[verse 8] And Jesus answered and said unto him, It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

2344,Luke 4:16-21,"[Luke] [ch 4] [verse 16] And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and he entered, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read. [verse 17] And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And he opened the book, and found the place where it was written, [verse 18] The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, Because he anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor: He hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives, And recovering of sight to the blind, To set at liberty them that are bruised, [verse 19] To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. [verse 20] And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him. [verse 21] And he began to say unto them, To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears."
2345,Luke 4:28-30,"[Luke] [ch 4] [verse 28] And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things; [verse 29] and they rose up, and cast him forth out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong. [verse 30] But he passing through the midst of them went his way."
2346,Luke 4:31-37,"[Luke] [ch 4] [verse 31] And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath day: [verse 32] and they were astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority. [verse 33] And in the synagogue there was a man, that had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice, [verse 34] Ah! what have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. [verse 35] And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no hurt. [verse 36] And amazement came upon all, and they spake together, one with another, saying, What is this word? for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out. [verse 37] And there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about."
2347,Luke 4:38-39,"[Luke] [ch 4] [verse 38] And he rose up from the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon. And Simon's wife's mother was holden with a great fever; and they besought him for her. [verse 39] And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them."
2348,Luke 4:40-41,"[Luke] [ch 4] [verse 40] And when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. [verse 41] And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ."
2349,Luke 5:1-11,"[Luke] [ch 5] [verse 1] Now it came to pass, while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret; [verse 10] and so were also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. [verse 11] And when they had brought their boats to land, they left all, and followed him. [verse 2] and he saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets. [verse 3] And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat. [verse 4] And when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. [verse 5] And Simon answered and said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing: but at thy word I will let down the nets. [verse 6] And when they had done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes; and their nets were breaking; [verse 7] and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. [verse 8] But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. [verse 9] For he was amazed, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken;"
2350,Luke 5:12-16,"[Luke] [ch 5] [verse 12] And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy: and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. [verse 13] And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway the leprosy departed from him. [verse 14] And he charged him to tell no man: but go thy way, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. [verse 15] But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities. [verse 16] But he withdrew himself in the deserts, and prayed."
2351,Luke 5:17-26,"[Luke] [ch 5] [verse 17] And it came to pass on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was with him to heal. [verse 18] And behold, men bring on a bed a man that was palsied: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him. [verse 19] And not finding by what [way] they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the midst before Jesus. [verse 20] And seeing their faith, he said, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. [verse 21] And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? [verse 22] But Jesus perceiving their reasonings, answered and said unto them, Why reason ye in your hearts? [verse 23] Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk? [verse 24] But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he said unto him that was palsied), I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go unto thy house. [verse 25] And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God. [verse 26] And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to-day."
2352,Luke 6:6-11,"[Luke] [ch 6] [verse 10] And he looked round about on them all, and said unto him, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did [so] : and his hand was restored. [verse 11] But they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus. [verse 6] And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man there, and his right hand was withered. [verse 7] And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find how to accuse him. [verse 8] But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man that had his hand withered, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth. [verse 9] And Jesus said unto them, I ask you, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to destroy it?"
2353,Luke 7:1-10,"[Luke] [ch 7] [verse 1] After he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum. [verse 10] And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole. [verse 2] And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick and at the point of death. [verse 3] And when he heard concerning Jesus, he sent unto him elders of the Jews, asking him that he would come and save his servant. [verse 4] And they, when they came to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him; [verse 5] for he loveth our nation, and himself built us our synagogue. [verse 6] And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: [verse 7] wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say the word, and my servant shall be healed. [verse 8] For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. [ [verse 9] And when Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned and said unto the multitude that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."
2354,Luke 7:11-17,"[Luke] [ch 7] [verse 11] And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great multitude. [verse 12] Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, there was carried out one that was dead, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. [verse 13] And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. [verse 14] And he came nigh and touched the bier: and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. [verse 15] And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother. [verse 16] And fear took hold on all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is arisen among us: and, God hath visited his people. [verse 17] And this report went forth concerning him in the whole of Judaea, and all the region round about."
2355,Luke 8:22-25,"[Luke] [ch 8] [verse 22] Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth. [verse 23] But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling [with water], and were in jeopardy. [verse 24] And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. [verse 25] And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And being afraid they marvelled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"
2356,Luke 8:26-39,"[Luke] [ch 8] [verse 26] And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is over against Galilee. [verse 27] And when he was come forth upon the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had demons; and for a long time he had worn no clothes, and abode not in [any] house, but in the tombs. [verse 28] And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, torment me not. [verse 29] For he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands asunder, he was driven of the demon into the deserts. [verse 30] And Jesus asked him, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; for many demons were entered into him. [verse 31] And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss. [verse 32] Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them. And he gave them leave. [verse 33] And the demons came out from the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned. [verse 34] And when they that fed them saw what had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country. [verse 35] And they went out to see what had come to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons were gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid. [verse 36] And they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole. [verse 37] And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them, for they were holden with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned. [verse 38] But the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying, [verse 39] Return to thy house, and declare how great things God hath done for thee. And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done for him."
2357,Luke 8:43-48,"[Luke] [ch 8] [verse 43] And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed of any, [verse 44] came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately the issue of her blood stanched. [verse 45] And Jesus said, Who is it that touched me? And when all denied, Peter said, and they that were with him, Master, the multitudes press thee and crush [thee] . [verse 46] But Jesus said, Some one did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me. [verse 47] And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately. [verse 48] And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace."
2358,"Luke 8:40-42, 49-56","[Luke] [ch 8] [verse 40] And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him. [verse 41] And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him to come into his house; [verse 42] for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went the multitudes thronged him. [verse 49] While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's [house], saying, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher. [verse 50] But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made whole. [verse 51] And when he came to the house, he suffered not any man to enter in with him, save Peter, and John, and James, and the father of the maiden and her mother. [verse 52] And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Weep not; for she is not dead, but sleepeth. [verse 53] And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. [verse 54] But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maiden, arise. [verse 55] And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he commanded that [something] be given her to eat. [verse 56] And her parents were amazed: but he charged them to tell no man what had been done."
2359,Luke 9:1-2,"[Luke] [ch 9] [verse 1] And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. [verse 2] And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick."
2360,Luke 9:10-17,"[Luke] [ch 9] [verse 10] And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida. [verse 11] But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he cured. [verse 12] And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place. [verse 13] But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people. [verse 14] For they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each. [verse 15] And they did so, and made them all sit down. [verse 16] And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. [verse 17] And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets."

2364,Luke 9:37-43,"[Luke] [ch 9] [verse 37] And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him. [verse 38] And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child: [verse 39] and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely. [verse 40] And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not. [verse 41] And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son. [verse 42] And as he was yet a coming, the demon dashed him down, and tare [him] grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. [verse 43] And they were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples,"
2365,"Luke 10:1, 17-20","[Luke] [ch 10] [verse 1] Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself was about to come. [verse 17] And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject unto us in thy name. [verse 18] And he said unto them, I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven. [verse 19] Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any wise hurt you. [verse 20] Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."
2366,Luke 10:21-22,"[Luke] [ch 10] [verse 21] In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight. [verse 22] All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father; and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal [him] ."
2367,Luke 11:14,"[Luke] [ch 11] [verse 14] And he was casting out a demon [that was] dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the dumb man spake; and the multitudes marvelled."

[verse 12] And when Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. [verse 13] And he laid his hands upon her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. [verse 14] And the ruler of the synagogue, being moved with indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, answered and said to the multitude, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the day of the sabbath. [verse 15] But the Lord answered him, and said, Ye hypocrites, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? [verse 16] And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound, lo, [these] eighteen years, to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath? [verse 17] And as he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame: and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him."
2369,Luke 14:1-6,"[Luke] [ch 14] [verse 1] And it came to pass, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him. [verse 2] And behold, there was before him a certain man that had the dropsy. [verse 3] And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath, or not? [verse 4] But they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go. [verse 5] And he said unto them, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a well, and will not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day?

[verse 14] And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go and show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed. [verse 15] And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God; [verse 16] and he fell upon his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. [verse 17] And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but where are the nine? [verse 18] Were there none found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger? [verse 19] And he said unto him, Arise, and go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole."
2371,Luke 18:35-43,"[Luke] [ch 18] [verse 35] And it came to pass, as he drew nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: [verse 36] and hearing a multitude going by, he inquired what this meant.

[verse 39] And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. [verse 40] And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, [verse 41] What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. [verse 42] And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight; thy faith hath made thee whole. [verse 43] And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God."
2372,Luke 19:1-10,"[Luke] [ch 19] [verse 1] And he entered and was passing through Jericho. [verse 10] For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.

[verse 3] And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature. [verse 4] And he ran on before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. [verse 5] And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to-day I must abide at thy house. [verse 6] And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. [verse 7] And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner. [verse 8] And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man, I restore fourfold. [verse 9] And Jesus said unto him, To-day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham."

[verse 33] And he said unto him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death.

2379,Luke 24:5-7,"[Luke] [ch 24] [verse 5] and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?

2380,Luke 24:13-35,"[Luke] [ch 24] [verse 13] And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem. [verse 14] And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened. [verse 15] And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. [verse 16] But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. [verse 17] And he said unto them, What communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad. [verse 18] And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days? [verse 19] And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: [verse 20] and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. [verse 21] But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yea and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass. [verse 22] Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb; [verse 23] and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. [verse 24] And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. [verse 25] And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! [verse 26] Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory? [verse 27] And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. [verse 28] And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further. [verse 29] And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them. [verse 30] And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking [it] he gave to them. [verse 31] And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. [verse 32] And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures? [verse 33] And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, [verse 34] saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. [verse 35] And they rehearsed the things [that happened] in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread."
2381,Luke 24:36-49,"[Luke] [ch 24] [verse 36] And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you. [verse 37] But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit. [verse 38] And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart? [verse 39] See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having. [verse 40] And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. [verse 41] And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat? [verse 42] And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish . [verse 43] And he took it, and ate before them. [verse 44] And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me. [verse 45] Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures; [verse 46] and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day; [verse 47] and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem. [verse 48] Ye are witnesses of these things. [verse 49] And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high."
2382,Luke 24:50-53,"[Luke] [ch 24] [verse 50] And he led them out until [they were] over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. [verse 51] And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven. [verse 52] And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: [verse 53] and were continually in the temple, blessing God."
2383,John 1:1-18,"[John] [ch 1] [verse 1] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [verse 10] He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not. [verse 11] He came unto his own, and they that were his own received him not. [verse 12] But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: [verse 13] who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. [verse 14] And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth. [verse 15] John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is become before me: for he was before me. [verse 16] For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace. [verse 17] For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. [verse 18] No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him] . [verse 2] The same was in the beginning with God. [verse 3] All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that hath been made. [verse 4] In him was life; and the life was the light of men. [verse 5] And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not. [verse 6] There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John. [verse 7] The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him. [verse 8] He was not the light, but [came] that he might bear witness of the light. [verse 9] There was the true light, [even the light] which lighteth every man, coming into the world."
2384,John 1:32-34,"[John] [ch 1] [verse 32] And John bare witness, saying, I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him. [verse 33] And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit. [verse 34] And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."
2385,John 2:1-11,"[John] [ch 2] [verse 1] And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: [verse 10] and saith unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and when [men] have drunk freely, [then] that which is worse: thou hast kept the good wine until now. [verse 11] This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him. [verse 2] and Jesus also was bidden, and his disciples, to the marriage. [verse 3] And when the wine failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. [verse 4] And Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. [verse 5] His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. [verse 6] Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece. [verse 7] Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. [verse 8] And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast. And they bare it. [verse 9] And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom,"
2386,John 2:19-22,"[John] [ch 2] [verse 19] Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. [verse 20] The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days? [verse 21] But he spake of the temple of his body. [verse 22] When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said."
2387,John 3:1-21,"[John] [ch 3] [verse 1] Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: [verse 10] Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things? [verse 11] Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. [verse 12] If I told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things? [verse 13] And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven, [even] the Son of man, who is in heaven. [verse 14] And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up; [verse 15] that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life. [verse 16] For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life. [verse 17] For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him. [verse 18] He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God. [verse 19] And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil. [verse 2] the same came unto him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him. [verse 20] For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved. [verse 21] But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God. [verse 3] Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God. [verse 4] Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born? [verse 5] Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God! [verse 6] That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. [verse 7] Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew. [verse 8] The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. [verse 9] Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?"
2388,"John 4:16-19, 25-26","[John] [ch 4] [verse 16] Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. [verse 17] The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband: [verse 18] for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly. [verse 19] The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. [verse 25] The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things. [verse 26] Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am [he] ."
2389,John 4:46-54,"[John] [ch 4] [verse 46] He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. [verse 47] When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought [him] that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. [verse 48] Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe. [verse 49] The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. [verse 50] Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way. [verse 51] And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived. [verse 52] So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. [verse 53] So the father knew that [it was] at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. [verse 54] This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee."
2390,John 5:1-15,"[John] [ch 5] [verse 1] After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. [verse 10] So the Jews said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed. [verse 11] But he answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. [verse 12] They asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up [thy bed], and walk? [verse 13] But he that was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place. [verse 14] Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee. [verse 15] The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole. [verse 2] Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep [gate] a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches. [verse 3] In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered, [verse 4] (Ommitted) [verse 5] And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity. [verse 6] When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time [in that case], he saith unto him, Wouldest thou be made whole? [verse 7] The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. [verse 8] Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk. [verse 9] And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was the sabbath on that day."
2391,John 6:1-15,"[John] [ch 6] [verse 1] After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is [the sea] of Tiberias. [verse 10] Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. [verse 11] Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down; likewise also of the fishes as much as they would. [verse 12] And when they were filled, he saith unto his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing be lost. [verse 13] So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which remained over unto them that had eaten. [verse 14] When therefore the people saw the sign which he did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world. [verse 15] Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain himself alone. [verse 2] And a great multitude followed him, because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick. [verse 3] And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. [verse 4] Now the passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand. [verse 5] Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude cometh unto him, saith unto Philip, Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat? [verse 6] And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. [verse 7] Philip answered him, Two hundred shillings' worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little. [verse 8] One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, [verse 9] There is a lad here, who hath five barley loaves, and two fishes: but what are these among so many?"
2392,John 6:16-21,"[John] [ch 6] [verse 16] And when evening came, his disciples went down unto the sea; [verse 17] and they entered into a boat, and were going over the sea unto Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. [verse 18] And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew. [verse 19] When therefore they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the boat: and they were afraid. [verse 20] But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid. [verse 21] They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat: and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going."
2393,John 6:35-71,"[John] [ch 6] [verse 35] Jesus said unto them. I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. [verse 36] But I said unto you, that ye have seen me, and yet believe not. [verse 37] All that which the Father giveth me shall come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. [verse 38] For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. [verse 39] And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all that which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day. [verse 40] For this is the will of my Father, that every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. [verse 41] The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven. [verse 42] And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how doth he now say, I am come down out of heaven? [verse 43] Jesus answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves. [verse 44] No man can come to me, except the Father that sent me draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day. [verse 45] It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me. [verse 46] Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he that is from God, he hath seen the Father. [verse 47] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth hath eternal life. [verse 48] I am the bread of life. [verse 49] Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. [verse 50] This is the bread which cometh down out of heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. [verse 51] I am the living bread which came down out of heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: yea and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world. [verse 52] The Jews therefore strove one with another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? [verse 53] Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have not life in yourselves. [verse 54] He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day. [verse 55] For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. [verse 56] He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him. [verse 57] As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me. [verse 58] This is the bread which came down out of heaven: not as the fathers ate, and died; he that eateth this bread shall live for ever. [verse 59] These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. [verse 60] Many therefore of his disciples, when the heard [this], said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it? [verse 61] But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said unto them, Doth this cause you to stumble? [verse 62] [ What] then if ye should behold the Son of man ascending where he was before? [verse 63] It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are life. [verse 64] But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who it was that should betray him. [verse 65] And he said, For this cause have I said unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it be given unto him of the Father. [verse 66] Upon this many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. [verse 67] Jesus said therefore unto the twelve, Would ye also go away? [verse 68] Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. [verse 69] And we have believed and know that thou art the Holy One of God. [verse 70] Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil? [verse 71] Now he spake of Judas [the son] of Simon Iscariot, for he it was that should betray him, [being] one of the twelve."
2394,John 6:64,"[John] [ch 6] [verse 64] But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who it was that should betray him."
2395,John 8:58,"[John] [ch 8] [verse 58] Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am."
2396,John 8:59,"[John] [ch 8] [verse 59] They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple."
2397,John 9:1-41,"[John] [ch 9] [verse 1] And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth. [verse 10] They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened? [verse 11] He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight. [verse 12] And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not. [verse 13] They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. [verse 14] Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. [verse 15] Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see. [verse 16] Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them. [verse 17] They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet. [verse 18] The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight, [verse 19] and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see? [verse 2] And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind? [verse 20] His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: [verse 21] but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself. [verse 22] These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him [to be] Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. [verse 23] Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. [verse 24] So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner. [verse 25] He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. [verse 26] They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes? [verse 27] He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples? [verse 28] And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses. [verse 29] We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is. [verse 3] Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. [verse 30] The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and [yet] he opened mine eyes. [verse 31] We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth. [verse 32] Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind. [verse 33] If this man were not from God, he could do nothing. [verse 34] They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. [verse 35] Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? [verse 36] He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? [verse 37] Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee. [verse 38] And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. [verse 39] And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind. [verse 4] We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. [verse 40] Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind? [verse 41] Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth. [verse 5] When I am in the world, I am the light of the world. [verse 6] When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay, [verse 7] and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing. [verse 8] The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? [verse 9] Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am [he] ."
2398,John 10:11-18,"[John] [ch 10] [verse 11] I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep. [verse 12] He that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth [them] : [verse 13] [ he fleeth] because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep. [verse 14] I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me, [verse 15] even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. [verse 16] And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice: and they shall become one flock, one shepherd. [verse 17] Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. [verse 18] No one taketh it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father."
2399,John 10:39,[John] [ch 10] [verse 39] They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.
2400,"John 11:4, 11-14","[John] [ch 11] [verse 11] These things spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. [verse 12] The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover. [verse 13] Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep. [verse 14] Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. [verse 4] But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby."
2401,John 11:17-44,"[John] [ch 11] [verse 17] So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already. [verse 18] Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off; [verse 19] and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother. [verse 20] Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house. [verse 21] Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. [verse 22] And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee. [verse 23] Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. [verse 24] Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. [verse 25] Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live; [verse 26] and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Believest thou this? [verse 27] She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, [even] he that cometh into the world. [verse 28] And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calleth thee. [verse 29] And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him. [verse 30] (Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.) [verse 31] The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there. [verse 32] Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. [verse 33] When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews [also] weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, [verse 34] and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see. [verse 35] Jesus wept. [verse 36] The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him! [verse 37] But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also should not die? [verse 38] Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it. [verse 39] Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the body decayeth; for he hath been [dead] four days. [verse 40] Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of God? [verse 41] So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me. [verse 42] And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me. [verse 43] And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. [verse 44] He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go."
2402,John 12:28-30,"[John] [ch 12] [verse 28] Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, [saying], I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. [verse 29] The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him. [verse 30] Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes."
2403,John 12:32-33,"[John] [ch 12] [verse 32] And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself. [verse 33] But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die."
2404,John 13:1-3,"[John] [ch 13] [verse 1] Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto his Father, having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them unto the end. [verse 2] And during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son], to betray him, [verse 3] [ Jesus], knowing that the Father had given all the things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and goeth unto God,"
2405,John 13:4-17,"[John] [ch 13] [verse 10] Jesus saith to him, He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. [verse 11] For he knew him that should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. [verse 12] So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? [verse 13] Ye call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. [verse 14] If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. [verse 15] For I have given you an example, that ye also should do as I have done to you. [verse 16] Verily, verily, I say unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him. [verse 17] If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them. [verse 4] riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments; and he took a towel, and girded himself. [verse 5] Then he poureth water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. [verse 6] So he cometh to Simon Peter. He saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? [verse 7] Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt understand hereafter. [verse 8] Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. [verse 9] Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head."
2406,John 13:18-30,"[John] [ch 13] [verse 18] I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me. [verse 19] From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am [he] . [verse 20] Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. [verse 21] When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. [verse 22] The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. [verse 23] There was at the table reclining in Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. [verse 24] Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, and saith unto him, Tell [us] who it is of whom he speaketh. [verse 25] He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? [verse 26] Jesus therefore answereth, He it is, for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the sop, he taketh and giveth it to Judas, [the son] of Simon Iscariot. [verse 27] And after the sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore saith unto him, What thou doest, do quickly. [verse 28] Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. [verse 29] For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said unto him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. [verse 30] He then having received the sop went out straightway: and it was night."
2407,John 13:36-38,"[John] [ch 13] [verse 36] Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered, Whither I go, thou canst not follow now; but thou shalt follow afterwards. [verse 37] Peter saith unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee even now? I will lay down my life for thee. [verse 38] Jesus answereth, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice."
2408,"John 14:16-17, 26","[John] [ch 14] [verse 16] And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, [verse 17] [ even] the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you. [verse 26] But the Comforter, [even] the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you."
2409,John 14:8-11,"[John] [ch 14] [verse 10] Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I say unto you I speak not from myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his works. [verse 11] Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake. [verse 8] Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. [verse 9] Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou, Show us the Father?"
2410,John 14:13-14,"[John] [ch 14] [verse 13] And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. [verse 14] If ye shall ask anything in my name, that will I do."
2411,John 16:7-15,"[John] [ch 16] [verse 10] of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye behold me no more; [verse 11] of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged. [verse 12] I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. [verse 13] Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, [these] shall he speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come. [verse 14] He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare [it] unto you. [verse 15] All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare [it] unto you. [verse 7] Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you. [verse 8] And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: [verse 9] of sin, because they believe not on me;"
2412,John 17:1-26,"[John] [ch 17] [verse 1] These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the son may glorify thee: [verse 10] and all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them. [verse 11] And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we [are] . [verse 12] While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled. [verse 13] But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves. [verse 14] I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. [verse 15] I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil [one] . [verse 16] They are not of the world even as I am not of the world. [verse 17] Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth. [verse 18] As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world. [verse 19] And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth. [verse 2] even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that to all whom thou hast given him, he should give eternal life. [verse 20] Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word; [verse 21] that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, [art] in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send me. [verse 22] And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we [are] one; [verse 23] I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me. [verse 24] Father, I desire that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. [ [verse 25] O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me; [verse 26] and I made known unto them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them. [verse 3] And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, [even] Jesus Christ. [verse 4] I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do. [verse 5] And now, Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. [verse 6] I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word. [verse 7] Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee: [verse 8] for the words which thou gavest me I have given unto them; and they received [them], and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me. [verse 9] I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine:"
2413,John 18:4-6,"[John] [ch 18] [verse 4] Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye? [verse 5] They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am [he] . And Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them. [verse 6] When therefore he said unto them, I am [he], they went backward, and fell to the ground."
2414,John 18:10-11,"[John] [ch 18] [verse 10] Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant's name was Malchus. [verse 11] Jesus therefore said unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?"
2415,John 18:37,"[John] [ch 18] [verse 37] Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice."
2416,John 19:26-27,"[John] [ch 19] [verse 26] When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! [verse 27] Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own [home] ."
2417,John 19:30,"[John] [ch 19] [verse 30] When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit."
2418,John 19:34,"[John] [ch 19] [verse 34] howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water."
2419,John 20:1-10,"[John] [ch 20] [verse 1] Now on the first [day] of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, unto the tomb, and seeth the stone taken away from the tomb. [verse 10] So the disciples went away again unto their own home. [verse 2] She runneth therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him. [verse 3] Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb. [verse 4] And they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb; [verse 5] and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in. [verse 6] Simon Peter therefore also cometh, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying, [verse 7] and the napkin, that was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself. [verse 8] Then entered in therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed. [verse 9] For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise from the dead."
2420,John 20:11-18,"[John] [ch 20] [verse 11] But Mary was standing without at the tomb weeping: so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb; [verse 12] and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. [verse 13] And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. [verse 14] When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. [verse 15] Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. [verse 16] Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher. [verse 17] Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God. [verse 18] Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and [that] he had said these things unto her."
2421,John 20:19-23,"[John] [ch 20] [verse 19] When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first [day] of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you. [verse 20] And when he had said this, he showed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord. [verse 21] Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace [be] unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you. [verse 22] And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit: [verse 23] whose soever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them; whose soever [sins] ye retain, they are retained."
2422,John 20:24-29,"[John] [ch 20] [verse 24] But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. [verse 25] The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe. [verse 26] And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace [be] unto you. [verse 27] Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and reach [hither] thy hand, and put it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. [verse 28] Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. [verse 29] Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed [are] they that have not seen, and [yet] have believed."
2423,John 21:1-14,"[John] [ch 21] [verse 1] After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested [himself] on this wise. [verse 10] Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now taken. [verse 11] Simon Peter therefore went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, the net was not rent. [verse 12] Jesus saith unto them, Come [and] break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. [verse 13] Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise. [verse 14] This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead. [verse 2] There was together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. [verse 3] Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing. [verse 4] But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. [verse 5] Jesus therefore saith unto them, Children, have ye aught to eat? They answered him, No. [verse 6] And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. [verse 7] That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea. [verse 8] But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net [full] of fishes. [verse 9] So when they got out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread."
2424,John 21:18-19,"[John] [ch 21] [verse 18] Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. [verse 19] Now this he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me."
2425,John 21:22-23,"[John] [ch 21] [verse 22] Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what [is that] to thee? Follow thou me. [verse 23] This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what [is that] to thee?"
2426,Acts 1:9-11,"[Acts] [ch 1] [verse 10] And while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; [verse 11] who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking into heaven? this Jesus, who was received up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven. [verse 9] And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight."
2427,Acts 2:1-4,"[Acts] [ch 2] [verse 1] And when the day of Pentecost was now come, they were all together in one place. [verse 2] And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. [verse 3] And there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them. [verse 4] And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance."
2428,Acts 2:4-11,"[Acts] [ch 2] [verse 10] in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, [verse 11] Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God. [verse 4] And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. [verse 5] Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. [verse 6] And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speaking in his own language. [verse 7] And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying, Behold, are not all these that speak Galilaeans? [verse 8] And how hear we, every man in our own language wherein we were born? [verse 9] Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,"
2429,Acts 3:1-10,"[Acts] [ch 3] [verse 1] Now Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, [being] the ninth [hour] . [verse 10] and they took knowledge of him, that it was he that sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him. [verse 2] And a certain man that was lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; [verse 3] who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms. [verse 4] And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him, with John, said, Look on us. [verse 5] And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something from them. [verse 6] But Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but what I have, that give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk. [verse 7] And he took him by the right hand, and raised him up: and immediately his feet and his ankle-bones received strength. [verse 8] And leaping up, he stood, and began to walk; and he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. [verse 9] And all the people saw him walking and praising God:"
2430,Acts 5:15-16,"[Acts] [ch 5] [verse 15] insomuch that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that, as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some one of them. [verse 16] And there also came together the multitudes from the cities round about Jerusalem, bring sick folk, and them that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one."
2431,Acts 5:17-20,"[Acts] [ch 5] [verse 17] But the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy, [verse 18] and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public ward. [verse 19] But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them out, and said, [verse 20] Go ye, and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this Life."
2432,Acts 5:1-11,"[Acts] [ch 5] [verse 1] But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, [verse 10] And she fell down immediately at his feet, and gave up the ghost: and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband. [verse 11] And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all that heard these things. [verse 2] and kept back [part] of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet. [verse 3] But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back [part] of the price of the land? [verse 4] While it remained, did it not remain thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thy power? How is it that thou hast conceived this thing in thy heart? thou has not lied unto men, but unto God. [verse 5] And Ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost: and great fear came upon all that heard it. [verse 6] And the young men arose and wrapped him round, and they carried him out and buried him. [verse 7] And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. [verse 8] And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yea, for so much. [verse 9] But Peter [said] unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to try the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them that have buried thy husband are at the door, and they shall carry thee out."
2433,Acts 7:55-56,"[Acts] [ch 7] [verse 55] But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, [verse 56] and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God."
2434,Acts 8:39-40,"[Acts] [ch 8] [verse 39] And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing. [verse 40] But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea."
2435,Acts 8:6-7,"[Acts] [ch 8] [verse 6] And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did. [verse 7] For [from] many of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed."
2436,Acts 8:14-19,"[Acts] [ch 8] [verse 14] Now when the apostles that were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: [verse 15] who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit: [verse 16] for as yet it was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. [verse 17] Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. [verse 18] Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money, [verse 19] saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit."
2437,Acts 9:3-9,"[Acts] [ch 9] [verse 3] And as he journeyed, it came to pass that he drew nigh unto Damascus: and suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven: [verse 4] and he fell upon the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? [verse 5] And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he [said], I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: [verse 6] but rise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. [verse 7] And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but beholding no man. [verse 8] And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. [verse 9] And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink."
2438,Acts 9:10-19,"[Acts] [ch 9] [verse 10] Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said unto him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I [am here], Lord. [verse 11] And the Lord [said] unto him, Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth; [verse 12] and he hath seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight. [verse 13] But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to thy saints at Jerusalem: [verse 14] and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name. [verse 15] But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel: [verse 16] for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name's sake. [verse 17] And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, [even] Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way which thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit. [verse 18] And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was baptized; [verse 19] and he took food and was strengthened. And he was certain days with the disciples that were at Damascus."
2439,Acts 9:32-35,"[Acts] [ch 9] [verse 32] And it came to pass, as Peter went throughout all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda. [verse 33] And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had kept his bed eight years; for he was palsied. [verse 34] And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee: arise and make thy bed. And straightway he arose. [verse 35] And all that dwelt at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord."
2440,Acts 9:36-43,"[Acts] [ch 9] [verse 36] Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did. [verse 37] And it came to pass in those days, that she fell sick, and died: and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber. [verse 38] And as Lydda was nigh unto Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men unto him, entreating him, Delay not to come on unto us. [verse 39] And Peter arose and went with them. And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. [verse 40] But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up. [verse 41] And he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. [verse 42] And it became known throughout all Joppa: and many believed on the Lord. [verse 43] And it came to pass, that he abode many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner."
2441,Acts 10:1-8,"[Acts] [ch 10] [verse 1] Now [there was] a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of the band called the Italian [band] , [verse 2] a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always. [verse 3] He saw in a vision openly, as it were about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius. [verse 4] And he, fastening his eyes upon him, and being affrighted, said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are gone up for a memorial before God. [verse 5] And now send men to Joppa, and fetch one Simon, who is surnamed Peter: [verse 6] he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side. [verse 7] And when the angel that spake unto him was departed, he called two of his household-servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; [verse 8] and having rehearsed all things unto them, he sent them to Joppa."
2442,Acts 10:9-16,"[Acts] [ch 10] [verse 10] and he became hungry, and desired to eat: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance; [verse 11] and he beholdeth the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth: [verse 12] wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven. [verse 13] And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill and eat. [verse 14] But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unclean. [verse 15] And a voice [came] unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common. [verse 16] And this was done thrice: and straightway the vessel was received up into heaven. [verse 9] Now on the morrow, as they were on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour:"
2443,Acts 10:44-48,"[Acts] [ch 10] [verse 44] While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard the word. [verse 45] And they of the circumcision that believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit. [verse 46] For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, [verse 47] Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we? [verse 48] And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days."
2444,Acts 12:6-11,"[Acts] [ch 12] [verse 10] And when they were past the first and the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and straightway the angel departed from him. [verse 11] And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. [verse 6] And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and guards before the door kept the prison. [verse 7] And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shined in the cell: and he smote Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. [verse 8] And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. [verse 9] And he went out, and followed; and he knew not that it was true which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision."
2445,Acts 12:20-23,"[Acts] [ch 12] [verse 20] Now he was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: and they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was fed from the king's country. [verse 21] And upon a set day Herod arrayed himself in royal apparel, and sat on the throne, and made an oration unto them. [verse 22] And the people shouted, [saying], The voice of a god, and not of a man. [verse 23] And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost."
2446,Acts 13:2-4,"[Acts] [ch 13] [verse 2] And as they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. [verse 3] Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away. [verse 4] So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus."
2447,Acts 13:8-12,"[Acts] [ch 13] [verse 10] and said, O full of all guile and all villany, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? [verse 11] And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. [verse 12] Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord. [verse 8] But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith. [verse 9] But Saul, who is also [called] Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,"
2448,Acts 14:8-10,"[Acts] [ch 14] [verse 10] said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked. [verse 8] And at Lystra there sat a certain man, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked. [verse 9] The same heard Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes upon him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,"
2449,Acts 14:11-18,"[Acts] [ch 14] [verse 11] And when the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. [verse 12] And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker. [verse 13] And the priest of Jupiter whose [temple] was before the city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes. [verse 14] But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the multitude, crying out [verse 15] and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good tidings, that ye should turn from these vain things unto a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: [verse 16] who in the generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways. [verse 17] And yet He left not himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness. [verse 18] And with these sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing sacrifice unto them."
2450,Acts 16:9-10,"[Acts] [ch 16] [verse 10] And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them. [verse 9] And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us."
2451,Acts 16:16-18,"[Acts] [ch 16] [verse 16] And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying. [verse 17] The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation. [verse 18] And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour."
2452,Acts 16:25-34,"[Acts] [ch 16] [verse 25] But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them; [verse 26] and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed. [verse 27] And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. [verse 28] But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. [verse 29] And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas, [verse 30] and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? [verse 31] And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house. [verse 32] And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house. [verse 33] And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately. [verse 34] And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God."
2453,Acts 19:11-12,"[Acts] [ch 19] [verse 11] And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: [verse 12] insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the evil spirits went out."
2454,Acts 19:13-16,"[Acts] [ch 19] [verse 13] But certain also of the strolling Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name over them that had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. [verse 14] And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this. [verse 15] And the evil spirit answered and said unto them, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye? [verse 16] And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded."
2455,Acts 20:7-12,"[Acts] [ch 20] [verse 10] And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Make ye no ado; for his life is in him. [verse 11] And when he was gone up, and had broken the bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even till break of day, so he departed. [verse 12] And they brought the lad alive, and were not a little comforted. [verse 7] And upon the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending to depart on the morrow; and prolonged his speech until midnight. [verse 8] And there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together. [verse 9] And there sat in the window a certain young man named Eutychus, borne down with deep sleep; and as Paul discoursed yet longer, being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead."
2456,Acts 21:10-11,"[Acts] [ch 21] [verse 10] And as we tarried there some days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus. [verse 11] And coming to us, and taking Paul's girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles."
2457,Acts 22:17-21,"[Acts] [ch 22] [verse 17] And it came to pass, that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance, [verse 18] and saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem; because they will not receive of thee testimony concerning me. [verse 19] And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee: [verse 20] and when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting, and keeping the garments of them that slew him. [verse 21] And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee forth far hence unto the Gentiles."
2458,Acts 23:11,"[Acts] [ch 23] [verse 11] And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as thou hast testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome."
2459,Acts 27:23-24,"[Acts] [ch 27] [verse 23] For there stood by me this night an angel of the God whose I am, whom also I serve, [verse 24] saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar: and lo, God hath granted thee all them that sail with thee."
2460,Acts 28:3-6,"[Acts] [ch 28] [verse 3] But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand. [verse 4] And when the barbarians saw the [venomous] creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live. [verse 5] Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm. [verse 6] But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god."
2461,Acts 28:7-9,"[Acts] [ch 28] [verse 7] Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and entertained us three days courteously. [verse 8] And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him. [verse 9] And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:"

[verse 18] Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So shall thy seed be. [verse 19] And without being weakened in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb; [verse 20] yet, looking unto the promise of God, he wavered not through unbelief, but waxed strong through faith, giving glory to God, [verse 21] and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.

2486,1 Corinthians 3:16-17,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 3] [verse 16] Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? [verse 17] If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye."
2487,1 Corinthians 4:5,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 4] [verse 5] Wherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each man have his praise from God."
2488,1 Corinthians 5:5,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 5] [verse 5] to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
2489,1 Corinthians 6:19,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 6] [verse 19] Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own;"
2490,1 Corinthians 7:15,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 7] [verse 15] Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such [cases] : but God hath called us in peace."
2491,1 Corinthians 8:6,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 8] [verse 6] yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him."
2492,"1 Corinthians 9:1-2, 17","[1 Corinthians] [ch 9] [verse 1] Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord? [verse 17] For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me. [verse 2] If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord."
2493,1 Corinthians 10:13,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 10] [verse 13] There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it."

[verse 4] Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. [verse 5] And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord. [verse 6] And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all. [verse 7] But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal. [verse 8] For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit: [verse 9] to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;"

2504,1 Corinthians 12:12-27,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 12] [verse 12] For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. [verse 13] For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit. [verse 14] For the body is not one member, but many. [verse 15] If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. [verse 16] And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. [verse 17] If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? [verse 18] But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him. [verse 19] And if they were all one member, where were the body? [verse 20] But now they are many members, but one body. [verse 21] And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. [verse 22] Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary: [verse 23] and those [parts] of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness; [verse 24] whereas our comely [parts] have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that [part] which lacked; [verse 25] that there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another. [verse 26] And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or [one] member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. [verse 27] Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof."
2505,1 Corinthians 12:28,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 12] [verse 28] And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, [divers] kinds of tongues."
2506,1 Corinthians 13:1-13,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 13] [verse 1] If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal. [verse 10] but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away. [verse 11] When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things. [verse 12] For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known. [verse 13] But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love. [verse 2] And if I have [the gift of] prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. [verse 3] And if I bestow all my goods to feed [the poor], and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing. [verse 4] Love suffereth long, [and] is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, [verse 5] doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil; [verse 6] rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth; [verse 7] beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. [verse 8] Love never faileth: but whether [there be] prophecies, they shall be done away; whether [there be] tongues, they shall cease; whether [there be] knowledge, it shall be done away. [verse 9] For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;"
2507,1 Corinthians 14:24-25,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 14] [verse 24] But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all; [verse 25] the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed."
2508,1 Corinthians 15:3-8,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 15] [verse 3] For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; [verse 4] and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures; [verse 5] and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve; [verse 6] then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep; [verse 7] then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles; [verse 8] and last of all, as to the [child] untimely born, he appeared to me also."
2509,1 Corinthians 15:5-6,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 15] [verse 5] and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve; [verse 6] then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep;"
2510,1 Corinthians 15:7,[1 Corinthians] [ch 15] [verse 7] then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;
2511,1 Corinthians 15:8,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 15] [verse 8] and last of all, as to the [child] untimely born, he appeared to me also."
2512,1 Corinthians 15:12-58,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 15] [verse 12] Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? [verse 13] But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised: [verse 14] and if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain. [verse 15] Yea, we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised. [verse 16] For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised: [verse 17] and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. [verse 18] Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished. [verse 19] If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable. [verse 20] But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep. [verse 21] For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead. [verse 22] For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. [verse 23] But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ's, at his coming. [verse 24] Then [cometh] the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power. [verse 25] For he must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet. [verse 26] The last enemy that shall be abolished is death. [verse 27] For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him. [verse 28] And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all. [verse 29] Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them? [verse 30] Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour? [verse 31] I protest by that glorifying in you, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. [verse 32] If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. [verse 33] Be not deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals. [verse 34] Awake to soberness righteously, and sin not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak [this] to move you to shame. [verse 35] But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come? [verse 36] Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die: [verse 37] and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind; [verse 38] but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own. [verse 39] All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one [flesh] of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes. [verse 40] There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the [glory] of the terrestrial is another. [verse 41] There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory. [verse 42] So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: [verse 43] it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: [verse 44] it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [body] . [verse 45] So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam [became] a life-giving spirit. [verse 46] Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual. [verse 47] The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven. [verse 48] As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. [verse 49] And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. [verse 50] Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. [verse 51] Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed, [verse 52] in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. [verse 53] For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. [verse 54] But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. [verse 55] O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting? [verse 56] The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law: [verse 57] but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. [verse 58] Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the Lord."
2513,"1 Corinthians 15:42-44, 51-52","[1 Corinthians] [ch 15] [verse 42] So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: [verse 43] it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: [verse 44] it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [body] . [verse 51] Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed, [verse 52] in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."

2515,1 Corinthians 15:54-57,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 15] [verse 54] But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. [verse 55] O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting? [verse 56] The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law: [verse 57] but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
2516,1 Corinthians 11:23-26,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 11] [verse 23] For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread; [verse 24] and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. [verse 25] In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink [it], in remembrance of me. [verse 26] For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord's death till he come."
2517,1 Corinthians 11:29-32,"[1 Corinthians] [ch 11] [verse 29] For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body. [verse 30] For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep. [verse 31] But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged. [verse 32] But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world."
2518,2 Corinthians 1:3-4,"[2 Corinthians] [ch 1] [verse 3] Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort; [verse 4] who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction, through the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God."
2519,2 Corinthians 1:8-10,"[2 Corinthians] [ch 1] [verse 10] who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver: on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us; [verse 8] For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which befell [us] in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, insomuch that we despaired even of life: [verse 9] yea, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead:"
2520,2 Corinthians 2:14,"[2 Corinthians] [ch 2] [verse 14] But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place."

2553,Galatians 3:19,"[Galatians] [ch 3] [verse 19] What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; [and it was] ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator."
2554,Galatians 3:16-18,"[Galatians] [ch 3] [verse 16] Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. [verse 17] Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect. [verse 18] For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise."
2555,Galatians 4:5-6,"[Galatians] [ch 4] [verse 5] that he might redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. [verse 6] And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father."
2556,Galatians 4:4,"[Galatians] [ch 4] [verse 4] but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,"
2557,Galatians 4:6,"[Galatians] [ch 4] [verse 6] And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father."
2558,Galatians 4:13-14,"[Galatians] [ch 4] [verse 13] but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time: [verse 14] and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus."
2559,Galatians 4:14,"[Galatians] [ch 4] [verse 14] and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus."
2560,Galatians 4:21-31,"[Galatians] [ch 4] [verse 21] Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? [verse 22] For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman. [verse 23] Howbeit the [son] by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the [son] by the freewoman [is born] through promise. [verse 24] Which things contain an allegory: for these [women] are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar. [verse 25] Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children. [verse 26] But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother. [verse 27] For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: For more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath the husband. [verse 28] Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise. [verse 29] But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit, so also it is now. [verse 30] Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman. [verse 31] Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman."

[verse 5] and ye have forgotten the exhortation which reasoneth with you as with sons, My son, regard not lightly the chastening of the Lord, Nor faint when thou art reproved of him; [verse 6] For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. [verse 7] It is for chastening that ye endure; God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there whom [his] father chasteneth not? [verse 8] But if ye are without chastening, whereof all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.

Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life. [verse 11] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.

[verse 12] and to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword: [verse 13] I know where thou dwellest, [even] where Satan's throne is; and thou holdest fast my name, and didst not deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwelleth. [verse 14] But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there some that hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication. [verse 15] So hast thou also some that hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner. [verse 16] Repent therefore; or else I come to thee quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth. [verse 17] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh, to him will I give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it. [verse 18] And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like unto burnished brass: [verse 19] I know thy works, and thy love and faith and ministry and patience, and that thy last works are more than the first. [verse 2] I know thy works, and thy toil and patience, and that thou canst not bear evil men, and didst try them that call themselves apostles, and they are not, and didst find them false; [verse 20] But I have [this] against thee, that thou sufferest the woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess; and she teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols. [verse 21] And I gave her time that she should repent; and she willeth not to repent of her fornication. [verse 22] Behold, I cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of her works. [verse 23] And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto each one of you according to your works. [verse 24] But to you I say, to the rest that are in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, who know not the deep things of Satan, as they are wont to say; I cast upon you none other burden. [verse 25] Nevertheless that which ye have, hold fast till I come. [verse 26] And he that overcometh, and he that keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give authority over the nations: [verse 27] and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the potter are broken to shivers; as I also have received of my Father: [verse 28] and I will give him the morning star. [verse 29] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. [verse 3] and thou hast patience and didst bear for my name's sake, and hast not grown weary. [verse 4] But I have [this] against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love. [verse 5] Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent. [verse 6] But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. [verse 7] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh, to him will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God. [verse 8] And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These things saith the first and the last, who was dead, and lived [again] : [verse 9] I know thy tribulation, and thy poverty (but thou art rich), and the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews, and they art not, but are a synagogue of Satan. [ch 3] [verse 1] And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and thou art dead. [verse 10] Because thou didst keep the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of trial, that [hour] which is to come upon the whole world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. [verse 11] I come quickly: hold fast that which thou hast, that no one take thy crown. [verse 12] He that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out thence no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and mine own new name. [verse 13] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. [verse 14] And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God: [verse 15] I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. [verse 16] So because thou art lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spew thee out of my mouth. [verse 17] Because thou sayest, I am rich, and have gotten riches, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art the wretched one and miserable and poor and blind and naked: [verse 18] I counsel thee to buy of me gold refined by fire, that thou mayest become rich; and white garments, that thou mayest clothe thyself, and [that] the shame of thy nakedness be not made manifest; and eyesalve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see. [verse 19] As many as I love, I reprove and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. [verse 2] Be thou watchful, and establish the things that remain, which were ready to die: for I have found no works of thine perfected before my God. [verse 20] Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. [verse 21] He that overcometh, I will give to him to sit down with me in my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father in his throne. [verse 22] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. [verse 3] Remember therefore how thou hast received and didst hear; and keep [it], and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee. [verse 4] But thou hast a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments: and they shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy. [verse 5] He that overcometh shall thus be arrayed in white garments; and I will in no wise blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. [verse 6] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. [verse 7] And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth and none shall shut, and that shutteth and none openeth: [verse 8] I know thy works (behold, I have set before thee a door opened, which none can shut), that thou hast a little power, and didst keep my word, and didst not deny my name. [verse 9] Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, of them that say they are Jews, and they are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee."

[verse 2] Straightway I was in the Spirit: and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne; [verse 3] and he that sat [was] to look upon like a jasper stone and a sardius: and [there was] a rainbow round about the throne, like an emerald to look upon. [verse 4] And round about the throne [were] four and twenty thrones: and upon the thrones [I saw] four and twenty elders sitting, arrayed in white garments; and on their heads crowns of gold. [verse 5] And out of the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders. And [there were] seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God; [verse 6] and before the throne, as it were a sea of glass like a crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind. [verse 7] And the first creature [was] like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face as of a man, and the fourth creature [was] like a flying eagle. [verse 8] and the four living creatures, having each one of them six wings, are full of eyes round about and within: and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, [is] the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.

[verse 8] and the four living creatures, having each one of them six wings, are full of eyes round about and within: and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, [is] the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come. [verse 9] And when the living creatures shall give glory and honor and thanks to him that sitteth on the throne, to him that liveth for ever and ever,"
2851,Revelation 5:1-7,"[Revelation] [ch 5] [verse 1] And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, close sealed with seven seals. [verse 2] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? [verse 3] And no one in the heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon. [verse 4] And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look thereon: [verse 5] and one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath overcome to open the book and the seven seals thereof. [verse 6] And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. [verse 7] And he came, and he taketh [it] out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne."
2852,Revelation 6:1-8:1,"[Revelation] [ch 6] [verse 1] And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, Come. [verse 10] and they cried with a great voice, saying, How long, O Master, the holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? [verse 11] And there was given them to each one a white robe; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little time, until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, who should be killed even as they were, should have fulfilled [their course] . [verse 12] And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood; [verse 13] and the stars of the heaven fell unto the earth, as a fig tree casteth her unripe figs when she is shaken of a great wind. [verse 14] And the heaven was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. [verse 15] And the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the chief captains, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains; [ [verse 16] and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: [verse 17] for the great day of their wrath is come; and who is able to stand? [verse 2] And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon had a bow; and there was given unto him a crown: and he came forth conquering, and to conquer. [verse 3] And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come. [verse 4] And another [horse] came forth, a red horse: and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. [verse 5] And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he that sat thereon had a balance in his hand. [verse 6] And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a shilling, and three measures of barley for a shilling; and the oil and the wine hurt thou not. [verse 7] And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come. [verse 8] And I saw, and behold, a pale horse: and he that sat upon him, his name was Death; and Hades followed with him. And there was given unto them authority over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth. [verse 9] And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: [ch 7] [verse 1] After his I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind should blow on the earth, or on the sea, or upon any tree. [verse 10] and they cry with a great voice, saying, Salvation unto our God who sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb. [verse 11] And all the angels were standing round about the throne, and [about] the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, [verse 12] saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, [be] unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. [verse 13] And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, These that are arrayed in white robes, who are they, and whence came they? [verse 14] And I say unto him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they that come out of the great tribulation, and they washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. [ [verse 15] Therefore are they before the throne of God; and they serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them. [verse 16] They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun strike upon them, nor any heat: [verse 17] for the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall be their shepherd, and shall guide them unto fountains of waters of life: and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes. [verse 2] And I saw another angel ascend from the sunrising, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, [verse 3] saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we shall have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads. [verse 4] And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel: [verse 5] Of the tribe of Judah [were] sealed twelve thousand: Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand; [verse 6] Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand; [verse 7] Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand; [verse 8] Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Benjamin [were] sealed twelve thousand.

2870,Revelation 9:1-12,"[Revelation] [ch 9] [verse 1] And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven fallen unto the earth: and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss. [verse 10] And they have tails like unto scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men five months. [verse 11] They have over them as king the angel of the abyss: his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek [tongue] he hath the name Apollyon. [verse 12] The first Woe is past: behold, there come yet two Woes hereafter. [verse 2] And he opened the pit of the abyss; and there went up a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.

[verse 6] And in those days men shall seek death, and shall in no wise find it; and they shall desire to die, and death fleeth from them. [verse 7] And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as it were crowns like unto gold, and their faces were as men's faces. [verse 8] And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as [teeth] of lions.

[verse 15] And the four angels were loosed, that had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they should kill the third part of men. [verse 16] And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand: I heard the number of them. [verse 17] And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates [as] of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone: and the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceedeth fire and smoke and brimstone. [verse 18] By these three plagues was the third part of men killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone, which proceeded out of their mouths. [verse 19] For the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails are like unto serpents, and have heads; and with them they hurt. [verse 20] And the rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk: [verse 21] and they repented not of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts."
2872,Revelation 10:1-4,"[Revelation] [ch 10] [verse 1] And I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, arrayed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire; [verse 2] and he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth; [verse 3] and he cried with a great voice, as a lion roareth: and when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.

2875,Revelation 10:8-11,"[Revelation] [ch 10] [verse 10] And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter. [verse 11] And they say unto me, Thou must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings. [verse 8] And the voice which I heard from heaven, [I heard it] again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.

[verse 11] And after the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that beheld them. [verse 12] And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they went up into heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them. [verse 3] And I will give unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. [verse 4] These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks, standing before the Lord of the earth. [verse 5] And if any man desireth to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies; and if any man shall desire to hurt them, in this manner must he be killed. [verse 6] These have the power to shut the heaven, that it rain not during the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they shall desire. [verse 7] And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.

[verse 9] If any man hath an ear, let him hear."
2886,Revelation 13:11-18,"[Revelation] [ch 13] [verse 11] And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like unto a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. [verse 12] And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his sight. And he maketh the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose death-stroke was healed. [verse 13] And he doeth great signs, that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven upon the earth in the sight of men. [verse 14] And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who hath the stroke of the sword and lived. [verse 15] And it was given [unto him] to give breath to it, [even] to the image to the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as should not worship the image of the beast should be killed. [verse 16] And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, that there be given them a mark on their right hand, or upon their forehead; [verse 17] and that no man should be able to buy or to sell, save he that hath the mark, [even] the name of the beast or the number of his name. [verse 18] Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred and sixty and six."
2887,Revelation 14:1-5,"[Revelation] [ch 14] [verse 1] And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads. [verse 2] And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and the voice which I heard [was] as [the voice] of harpers harping with their harps: [verse 3] and they sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, [even] they that had been purchased out of the earth. [verse 4] These are they that were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These [are] they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, [to be] the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb. [verse 5] And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish."
2888,Revelation 14:6-7,"[Revelation] [ch 14] [verse 6] And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people; [verse 7] and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters."
2889,Revelation 14:8-11,"[Revelation] [ch 14] [verse 10] he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: [verse 11] and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name. [verse 8] And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. [verse 9] And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand,"
2890,Revelation 14:13,"[Revelation] [ch 14] [verse 13] And I heard the voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them."
2891,Revelation 14:14-16,"[Revelation] [ch 14] [verse 14] And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud [I saw] one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand sharp sickle. [verse 15] And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. [verse 16] And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped."
2892,Revelation 14:17-20,"[Revelation] [ch 14] [verse 17] Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. [verse 18] And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. [verse 19] And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great [winepress], of the wrath of God. [verse 20] And the winepress was trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs."
2893,Revelation 15:1-8,"[Revelation] [ch 15] [verse 1] And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues, [which are] the last, for in them is finished the wrath of God. [verse 2] And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass, having harps of God. [verse 3] And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, thou King of the ages. [verse 4] Who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all the nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest. [verse 5] And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: [verse 6] and there came out from the temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with [precious] stone, pure [and] bright, and girt about their breasts with golden girdles. [verse 7] And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. [verse 8] And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished."
2894,Revelation 16:1-2,"[Revelation] [ch 16] [verse 1] And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go ye, and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God into the earth. [verse 2] And the first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth; and it became a noisome and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast, and that worshipped his image."
2895,Revelation 16:3,"[Revelation] [ch 16] [verse 3] And the second poured out his bowl into the sea; and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living soul died, [even] the things that were in the sea."
2896,Revelation 16:4-7,"[Revelation] [ch 16] [verse 4] And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of the waters; and it became blood. [verse 5] And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art and who wast, thou Holy One, because thou didst thus judge: [verse 6] for they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets, and blood hast thou given them to drink: they are worthy. [verse 7] And I heard the altar saying, Yea, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments."
2897,Revelation 16:8-9,[Revelation] [ch 16] [verse 8] And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given unto it to scorch men with fire. [verse 9] And men were scorched with great heat: and they blasphemed the name of God who hath the power over these plagues; and they repented not to give him glory.
2898,Revelation 16:10-11,"[Revelation] [ch 16] [verse 10] And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, [verse 11] and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they repented not of their works."
2899,Revelation 16:12,"[Revelation] [ch 16] [verse 12] And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river, the [river] Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way might by made ready for the kings that [come] from the sunrising."
2900,Revelation 16:13-14,"[Revelation] [ch 16] [verse 13] And I saw [coming] out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as it were frogs: [verse 14] for they are spirits of demons, working signs; which go forth unto the kings of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty."
2901,Revelation 16:17-21,"[Revelation] [ch 16] [verse 17] And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and there came forth a great voice out of the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done: [verse 18] and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men upon the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty. [verse 19] And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. [verse 20] And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. [verse 21] And great hail, [every stone] about the weight of a talent, cometh down out of heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof is exceeding great."
2902,Revelation 17:1-18,"[Revelation] [ch 17] [verse 1] And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls, and spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters; [verse 10] and they are seven kings; the five are fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a little while. [verse 11] And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goeth into perdition. [verse 12] And the ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour. [verse 13] These have one mind, and they give their power and authority unto the beast. [verse 14] These shall war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they [also shall overcome] that are with him, called and chosen and faithful. [verse 15] And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. [verse 16] And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her utterly with fire. [verse 17] For God did put in their hearts to do his mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished. [verse 18] And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth. [verse 2] with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and they that dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her fornication. [verse 3] And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. [verse 4] And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, even the unclean things of her fornication, [verse 5] and upon her forehead a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. [verse 6] And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with a great wonder. [verse 7] And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns. [verse 8] The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition. And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, [they] whose name hath not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast, how that he was, and is not, and shall come. [verse 9] Here is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth:"
2903,Revelation 18:1-3,"[Revelation] [ch 18] [verse 1] After these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was lightened with his glory. [verse 2] And he cried with a mighty voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird. [verse 3] For by the wine of the wrath of her fornication all the nations are fallen; and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth waxed rich by the power of her wantonness."
2904,Revelation 18:4-5,"[Revelation] [ch 18] [verse 4] And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come forth, my people, out of her, that ye have no fellowship with her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues: [verse 5] for her sins have reached even unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities."
2905,Revelation 18:8-19,"[Revelation] [ch 18] [verse 10] standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! for in one hour is thy judgment come. [verse 11] And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no man buyeth their merchandise any more; [verse 12] merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet; and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble; [verse 13] and cinnamon, and spice, and incense, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep; and [merchandise] of horses and chariots and [ slaves; and souls of men. [verse 14] And the fruits which thy soul lusted after are gone from thee, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous are perished from thee, and [men] shall find them no more at all. [verse 15] The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning; [verse 16] saying, Woe, woe, the great city, she that was arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearl! [verse 17] for in an hour so great riches is made desolate. And every shipmaster, and every one that saileth any whither, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood afar off, [verse 18] and cried out as they looked upon the smoke of her burning, saying, What [city] is like the great city? [verse 19] And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, wherein all that had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate. [verse 8] Therefore in one day shall her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judged her. [verse 9] And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication and lived wantonly with her, shall weep and wail over her, when they look upon the smoke of her burning,"
2906,Revelation 18:21,"[Revelation] [ch 18] [verse 21] And a strong angel took up a stone as it were a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with a mighty fall shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down, and shall be found no more at all."
2907,Revelation 19:1-10,"[Revelation] [ch 19] [verse 1] After these things I heard as it were a great voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah; Salvation, and glory, and power, belong to our God: [verse 10] And I fell down before his feet to worship him. And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren that hold the testimony of Jesus: worship God; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. [verse 2] for true and righteous are his judgments; for he hath judged the great harlot, her that corrupted the earth with her fornication, and he hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. [verse 3] And a second time they say, Hallelujah. And her smoke goeth up for ever and ever. [verse 4] And the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God that sitteth on the throne, saying, Amen; Hallelujah. [verse 5] And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Give praise to our God, all ye his servants, ye that fear him, the small and the great. [verse 6] And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah: for the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigneth. [verse 7] Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad, and let us give the glory unto him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. [verse 8] And it was given unto her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright [and] pure: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. [verse 9] And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they that are bidden to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are true words of God."
2908,Revelation 19:11-16,"[Revelation] [ch 19] [verse 11] And I saw the heaven opened; and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon called Faithful and True; and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. [verse 12] And his eyes [are] a flame of fire, and upon his head [are] many diadems; and he hath a name written which no one knoweth but he himself. [verse 13] And he [is] arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood: and his name is called The Word of God. [verse 14] And the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white [and] pure. [verse 15] And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty. [verse 16] And he hath on his garment and on his thigh a name written, KINGS OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."
2909,Revelation 19:17-18,"[Revelation] [ch 19] [verse 17] And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid heaven, Come [and] be gathered together unto the great supper of God; [verse 18] that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of them that sit thereon, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, and small and great."
2910,Revelation 19:19-21,"[Revelation] [ch 19] [verse 19] And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat upon the horse, and against his army. [verse 20] And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought the signs in his sight, wherewith he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image: they two were cast alive into the lake of fire that burneth with brimstone: [verse 21] and the rest were killed with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, [even the sword] which came forth out of his mouth: and all the birds were filled with their flesh."
2911,Revelation 20:1-3,"[Revelation] [ch 20] [verse 1] And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. [verse 2] And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, [verse 3] and cast him into the abyss, and shut [it], and sealed [it] over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years should be finished: after this he must be loosed for a little time."
2912,Revelation 20:4-6,"[Revelation] [ch 20] [verse 4] And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and [I saw] the souls of them that had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as worshipped not the beast, neither his image, and received not the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand; and they lived, and reigned with Christ a thousand years. [verse 5] The rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years should be finished. This is the first resurrection. [verse 6] Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years."
2913,Revelation 20:7-9,"[Revelation] [ch 20] [verse 7] And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, [verse 8] and shall come forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. [verse 9] And they went up over the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them."
2914,Revelation 20:9,"[Revelation] [ch 20] [verse 9] And they went up over the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them."
2915,Revelation 20:10,"[Revelation] [ch 20] [verse 10] And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
2916,Revelation 20:11-15,"[Revelation] [ch 20] [verse 11] And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. [verse 12] And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne; and books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works. [verse 13] And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. [verse 14] And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, [even] the lake of fire. [verse 15] And if any was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire."
2917,Revelation 20:12-13,"[Revelation] [ch 20] [verse 12] And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne; and books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works. [verse 13] And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works."
2918,Revelation 21:1,[Revelation] [ch 21] [verse 1] And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth are passed away; and the sea is no more.
2919,Revelation 21:2-27,"[Revelation] [ch 21] [verse 10] And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, [verse 11] having the glory of God: her light was like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal: [verse 12] having a wall great and high; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written thereon, which are [the names] of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: [verse 13] on the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. [verse 14] And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. [verse 15] And he that spake with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. [verse 16] And the city lieth foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height thereof are equal. [verse 17] And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits, [according to] the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. [verse 18] And the building of the wall thereof was jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto pure glass. [verse 19] The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; [verse 2] And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband. [verse 20] the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. [verse 21] And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the several gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. [verse 22] And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof. [verse 23] And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine upon it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp thereof [is] the Lamb. [verse 24] And the nations shall walk amidst the light thereof: and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it. [verse 25] And the gates thereof shall in no wise be shut by day (for there shall be no night there): [verse 26] and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it: [verse 27] and there shall in no wise enter into it anything unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a lie: but only they that are written in the Lamb's book of life. [verse 3] And I heard a great voice out of the throne saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them, and they shall be his peoples, and God himself shall be with them, [ [and be] their God: [verse 4] and he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more; neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more: the first things are passed away. [verse 5] And he that sitteth on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he saith, Write: for these words are faithful and true. [verse 6] And he said unto me, They are come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. [verse 7] He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. [verse 8] But for the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part [shall be] in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death. [verse 9] And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were laden with the seven last plagues; and he spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb."
2920,Revelation 21:3-5,"[Revelation] [ch 21] [verse 3] And I heard a great voice out of the throne saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them, and they shall be his peoples, and God himself shall be with them, [ [and be] their God: [verse 4] and he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more; neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more: the first things are passed away. [verse 5] And he that sitteth on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he saith, Write: for these words are faithful and true."
2921,Revelation 22:1,"[Revelation] [ch 22] [verse 1] And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,"
2922,Revelation 22:2,"[Revelation] [ch 22] [verse 2] in the midst of the street thereof. And on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve [manner of] fruits, yielding its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."
